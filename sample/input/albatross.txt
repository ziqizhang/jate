Albatrosses, of the biological family Diomedeidae, are large seabirds allied to the procellariids,
storm-petrels and diving-petrels in the order Procellariiformes (the tubenoses). They range widely
in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. They are absent from the North Atlantic, although
fossil remains show they once occurred there too and occasional vagrants turn up. Albatrosses are
amongst the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses (genus Diomedea) have the largest
wingspans of any extant birds. The albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera,
but there is disagreement over the number of species.

Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover
great distances with little exertion. They feed on squid, fish and krill by either scavenging,
surface seizing or diving. Albatrosses are colonial, nesting for the most part on remote oceanic
islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form
over several years, with the use of ritualised dances, and will last for the life of the pair. A
breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each
breeding attempt.

Of the 21 species of albatrosses recognised by the IUCN, 19 are threatened with extinction.
Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the
albatrosses are threatened by introduced species such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs,
chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions
largely due to overfishing; and by long-line fishing. Long-line fisheries pose the greatest
threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait and become hooked on the lines and drown.
Governments, conservation organisations and fishermen are all working towards reducing this
by-catch.

 Albatross biology
========================

 Taxonomy and evolution
=============================


The albatrosses comprise between 13 and 24 species (the number of species is still a matter of
some debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in 4 genera. The four genera are the
great albatrosses (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific albatrosses
(Phoebastria), and the sooty albatrosses or sooties (Phoebetria). Of the four genera, the North
Pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses, while the sooty
albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks.

The taxonomy of the albatross group has been a source of a great deal of debate. The
Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged
order Ciconiiformes, whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South
Africa, Australia and New Zealand retain the more traditional order Procellariiformes. The
albatrosses can be separated from the other Procellariiformes both genetically and through
morphological characteristics, size, their legs and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see
Morphology and flight).

Within the family the assignment of genera has been debated for over a hundred years. Originally
placed into a single genus, Diomedea, they were rearranged by Reichenbach into four different
genera in 1852, then lumped back together and split apart again several times, acquiring 12
different genus names in total (though never more than eight at one time) by 1965 (Diomedea,
Phoebastria, Thalassarche, Phoebetria, Thalassageron, Diomedella, Nealbutrus, Rhothonia,
Julietata, Galapagornis, Laysanornis, and Penthirenia).

By 1965, in an attempt to bring some order back to the classification of albatrosses, they were
lumped into two genera, Phoebetria (the sooty albatrosses which most closely seemed to resemble
the procellarids and were at the time considered "primitive" ) and Diomedea (the rest).[1] Though
there was a case for the simplification of the family (particularly the nomenclature), the
classification was based on the morphological analysis of Elliott Coues in 1866, and paid little
attention to more recent studies and even ignored some of Coues's suggestions.

More recent research by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) and other
researchers around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding
that there were four, not two, monophyletic groups within the albatrosses.[2] They proposed the
resurrection of two of the old genus names, Phoebastria for the North Pacific albatrosses and
Thalassarche for the mollymawks, with the great albatrosses retaining Diomedea and the sooty
albatrosses staying in Phoebetria. Both the British Ornithologists' Union and the South African
authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been
accepted by the majority of researchers.

While there is some agreement on the number of genera, there is less agreement on the number of
species. Historically, up to 80 different taxa have been described by different researchers; most
of these were incorrectly identified juvenile birds.[3] Based on the work on albatross genera,
Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species,[4]
compared to the 14 then accepted. This interim taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to
full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to
justify the splits. Since then further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the
splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with the
conclusion that the Antipodean Albatross and the Tristan Albatross were distinct from the
Wandering Albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's Albatross,
Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean Albatross.[5] For the most part, an interim
taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by the IUCN and many other researchers, though by no means all
â€” in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including
the lumping of the Amsterdam Albatross with the Wandering Albatross),[6] although this paper was
itself controversial.[3][7] On all sides, there is the widespread agreement on the need for
further research to clarify the issue.

Sibley and Ahlquist's molecular study of the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation
of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (35â€“30 million years ago), though this group
probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as
Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that
the storm-petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next,
with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were
found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the
faimly and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle
Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the
Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a
petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the
split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica
and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show
that the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya.
Similar fossil finds in the southern hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks
at 10 mya.[8] The fossil record of the albatrosses in the northern hemisphere is more complete
than that of the southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North
Atlantic, which today has no albatrosses. The remains of a colony of Short-tailed Albatrosses have
been uncovered on the island of Bermuda,[9] and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North
Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria (the North Pacific albatrosses); one, Phoebastria
anglica, has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England. See the genus accounts for
more data on fossil species.

 Morphology and flight
============================

Unlike most Procellariiformes, albatrosses, like this Black-footed Albatross, can walk well on
land.



The albatrosses are a group of large to very large birds; they are the largest of the
procellariiformes. The bill is large, strong and sharp-edged, the upper mandible terminating in a
large hook. This bill is composed of several horny plates, and along the sides are the two
"tubes", long nostrils that give the order its name. The tubes of all albatrosses are along the
sides of the bill, unlike the rest of the Procellariiformes where the tubes run along the top of
the bill. These tubes allow the albatrosses to have an acute sense of smell, an unusual ability
for birds. Like other Procellariiformes they use this olfactory ability while foraging in order to
locate potential food sources.[10] The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are
completely webbed. The legs are strong for Procellariiformes, in fact, almost uniquely amongst the
order in that they and the giant petrels are able to walk well on land.

The adult plumage of most of the albatrosses is usually some variation of dark upper-wing and
back, white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. Of these, the species range from the
Southern Royal Albatross which is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges
of the wings in fully mature males, to the Amsterdam Albatross which has an almost juvenile-like
breeding plumage with a great deal of brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest.
Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or
have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three albatross species, the Black-footed Albatross and
the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark
brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the Light-mantled Sooty Albatross). Albatrosses take
several years to get their full adult breeding plumage.

The wingspans of the largest great albatrosses (genus Diomedea) are the largest of any bird,
exceeding 340 cm (over 11 feet), although the other species' wingspans are considerably smaller.
The wings are stiff and cambered, with thickened streamlined leading edges. Albatrosses travel
huge distances with two techniques used by many long-winged seabirds, dynamic soaring and slope
soaring. Dynamic soaring enables them to minimise the effort needed by gliding across wave fronts
gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the
albatross turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea.
Albatross have high glide ratios, around 1:22 to 1:23, meaning that for every metre they drop,
they can travel forward 22 metres. They are aided in soaring by a shoulder-lock, a sheet of tendon
that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any
muscle expenditure, a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels.[11]

Taking off is one of the main times albatrosses use flapping in order to fly, and is the most
energetically demanding part of a journey.



Albatrosses combine these soaring techniques with the use of predictable weather systems;
albatrosses in the southern hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise
route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise.[12] Albatrosses are so well adapted to
this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when
resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip
is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a
food source.[13] This efficient long-distance travelling underlies the albatross's success as a
long-distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily
distributed food sources. Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and
waves, however, as their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the
muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight. Albatrosses in calm seas are forced to
rest on the ocean's surface until the wind picks up again. They also sleep while resting on the
surface (and not while on the wing as is sometimes thought). The North Pacific albatrosses can use
a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by
gliding.[14] When taking off, albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under
the wing to provide lift.


 Distribution and range at sea
====================================

The distribution of albatrosses across the world.



Most albatrosses range in the southern hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and
South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur
exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the Waved
Albatross, breeds in the Galapagos Islands and feeds off the coast of South America. The need for
wind in order to glide is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher
latitudes; being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely
difficult. The exception, the Waved Albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the
Galapagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.

Albatrosses range over huge areas of ocean and regularly circle the globe.



It is not known for certain why the albatrosses became extinct in the North Atlantic, although
rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period are thought to have submerged the site of
a Short-tailed Albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda.[9] Some southern species have
occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled, remaining there
for decades. One of these exiles, a Black-browed Albatross, returned to gannet colonies in
Scotland for many years in a lonely attempt to breed.[15]

The use of satellite tracking is teaching scientists a great deal about the way albatrosses forage
across the ocean in order to find food. They undertake no annual migration, but disperse widely
after breeding, in the case of southern hemisphere species, often undertaking circumpolar
trips.[16] There is also evidence that there is separation of the ranges of different species at
sea. A comparison of the foraging niches of two related species that breed on Campbell Island, the
Campbell Albatross and the Grey-headed Albatross, showed the Campbell Albatross primarily fed over
the Campbell Plateau whereas the Grey-Headed Albatross fed in more pelagic, oceanic waters.
Wandering Albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry, feeding only in waters deeper than 1000 m
(3281 feet); so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked,
"It almost appears as if the birds notice and obey a 'No Entry' sign where the water shallows to
less than 1000 m".[8] There is also evidence of different ranges for the two sexes of the same
species; a study of Tristan Albatrosses breeding on Gough Island showed that males foraged to the
west of Gough and females to the east.

 Diet
===========


The albatross diet is dominated by cephalopods, fish and crustaceans, although they will also
scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton.[12] It should be noted that for most species, a
comprehensive understanding of diet is only known for the breeding season, when the albatrosses
regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources
varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid
alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the
Black-footed Albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.

Light-mantled Sooty Albatrosses regularly dive in order to feed and can dive to below 12 m.



The use of dataloggers at sea that record ingestion of water against time (providing a likely time
of feeding) suggest that albatross predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks
regurgitated by albatrosses has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been
caught alive,[17] and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross,
suggesting that, for some species (like the Wandering Albatross), scavenged squid may be an
important part of the diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly
comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after
squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and Southern
Bottlenose Whales). The diet of other species, like the Black-browed Albatross or the Grey-headed
Albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is
not assumed to play a large role in their diet.

Until recently it was thought that albatross were predominantly surface feeders, swimming at the
surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents, predators or death. The
deployment of capillary depth recorders, which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird
(between attaching it to a bird and recovering it when it returns to land), has shown that while
some species, like the Wandering Albatross, do not dive deeper than a metre, some species, like
the Light-mantled Sooty Albatross, have a mean diving depth of almost 5 m and can dive as deep as
12.5 m.[18] In addition to surface feeding and diving, they have now also been observed plunge
diving from the air to snatch prey.[19]

 Breeding
===============

Wandering Albatrosses are colonial but have large widely spaced territories. Here a pair performs
their famous breeding dance.



Albatrosses are colonial, usually nesting on isolated islands; where colonies are on larger
landmasses, they are found on exposed headlands with good approaches from the sea in several
directions, like the colony on the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin, New Zealand. Colonies vary from the
very dense aggregations favoured by the mollymawks (Black-browed Albatross colonies on the
Falkland Islands have densities of 70 nests per 100 mÂ²) to the much looser groups and widely
spaced individual nests favoured by the sooty and great albatrosses. All albatross colonies are on
islands that historically were free of land mammals. Albatrosses are highly philopatric, meaning
they will usually return to their natal colony to breed. This tendency to return is so strong that
a study of Laysan Albatross showed that the average distance between hatching site and the site
where a bird established its own territory was 22 metres.[20]

Like most seabirds, albatrosses are K-selected with regard to their life history, meaning they
live much longer than other birds, they delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into
fewer young. Albatrosses are very long lived; most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest
recorded being a Northern Royal Albatross that was ringed as an adult and survived for another 51
years, giving it an estimated age of 61.[21] Given that most albatross ringing projects are
considerably younger than that, it is thought likely that other species will prove to live that
long and even longer.

Sky-pointing is one of the stereotyped actions of Laysan Albatross breeding dances.



Albatrosses reach sexual maturity slowly, after about five years, but even once they have reached
maturity, they will not begin to breed for another couple of years (even up to 10 years for some
species). Young non-breeders will attend a colony prior to beginning to breed, spending many years
practicing the elaborate breeding rituals and "dances" that the family is famous for.[22] Birds
arriving back at the colony for the first time already have the stereotyped behaviours that
compose albatross language, but can neither "read" that behaviour as exhibited by other birds nor
respond appropriately.[12] After a period of trial and error learning, the young birds learn the
syntax and perfect the dances. This language is mastered more rapidly if the younger birds are
around older birds.

The repertoire of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as
preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the
sky-call).[23] When a bird first returns to the colony it will dance with many partners, but after
a number of years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops, until one partner is
chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will
eventually be unique to that one pair. Having established a pair bond that will last for life,
however, most of that dance will never be used ever again.

Albatrosses are thought to undertake these elaborate and painstaking rituals to ensure that the
correct partner has been chosen and to perfect recognition of their partner, as egg laying and
chick rearing is a huge investment. Even species that can complete an egg-laying cycle in under a
year seldom lay eggs in consecutive years.[8] The great albatrosses (like the Wandering Albatross)
take over a year to raise a chick from laying to fledging. Albatrosses lay a single egg in a
breeding season; if the egg is lost to predators or accidentally broken, then no further breeding
attempts are made that year. The "divorce" of a pair is a rare occurrence, usually only happening
after several years of breeding failure.

All the southern albatrosses create large nests for their egg, whereas the three species in the
north Pacific make more rudimentary nests. The Waved Albatross, on the other hand, makes no nest
and will even move its egg around the pair's territory, as much as 50 m, sometimes causing it to
lose the egg.[24] In all albatross species, both parents incubate the egg in stints that last
between one day and three weeks. Incubation lasts around 70 to 80 days (longer for the larger
albatrosses), the longest incubation period of any bird. It can be an energetically demanding
process, with the adult losing as much as 83 g of body weight a day.[25]

After hatching, the chick is brooded and guarded for three weeks until it is large enough to
defend and thermoregulate itself. During this period the parents feed the chick small meals when
they relieve each other from duty. After the brooding period is over, the chick is fed in regular
intervals by both parents. The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging
trips, providing meals that weigh around 12% of their body weight (around 600 g). The meals are
composed of both fresh squid, fish and krill, as well as stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is
lighter to carry than undigested prey items.[26] This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a
proventriculus from digested prey items by most tubenoses, and gives them their distinctive musty
smell.

Albatrosses brood young chicks until they are large enough to defend themselves and thermoregulate.



Albatross chicks take a long time to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up
to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes anywhere between 140 and 170 days.[27]
Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and
prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all
their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Albatross chicks
fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after
fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an
innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when
they are first out at sea.[28]

 Albatrosses and humans
=============================

 Etymology
================


The name albatross is derived from the Arabic al-cÃ¢dous or al-Ä¡aÅ£Å£Ä?s (a pelican; literally,
"the diver"), which travelled to English via the Portuguese form alcatraz ("gannet"), which is
also the origin of the title of the former prison, Alcatraz. The OED notes that the word alcatraz
was originally applied to the frigatebird; the modification to albatross was perhaps influenced by
Latin albus, meaning "white", in contrast to frigatebirds which are black.[12] The Portuguese word
albatroz is of English origin.

They were once commonly known as Goonie birds or Gooney birds, particularly those of the North
Pacific. In the southern hemisphere, the name mollymawk is still well established in some areas,
which is a corrupted form of malle-mugge, an old Dutch name for the Northern Fulmar. The name
Diomedea, assigned to the albatrosses by Linnaeus, references the mythical metamorphosis of the
companions of the Greek warrior Diomedes into birds.

 Albatrosses and culture
==============================

A Northern Royal Albatross in flight at the colony in Taiaroa Head, New Zealand.



Albatrosses have been described as "the most legendary of all birds".[27] An albatross is a
central emblem in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge; a captive albatross
is also a metaphor for the poÃ¨te maudit in a poem of Charles Baudelaire. It is from the former
poem that the usage of albatross as a metaphor is derived; someone with a burden or obstacle is
said to have 'an albatross around their neck', the punishment given in the poem to the mariner who
killed the albatross. In part due to the poem, there is a widespread myth that sailors believe it
disastrous to shoot or harm an albatross; in truth, however, sailors regularly killed and ate
them,[15] but they were often regarded as the souls of lost sailors.

More recently, they have become part of popular culture, for example, in a Monty Python sketch. In
the movie Serenity, the character River was referred to as an albatross by The Operative,
reflecting the widespread adoption of the word as a metaphor. The Classic Crime's first album is
entitled "Albatross." A well known whaling song, noted in Gale Huntington's book, Songs the
Whalemen Sang is entitled "The Wings of a Goney." In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the third
book in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia series, an albatross is sent by the God-like figure
Aslan to guide a ship to safety.

Albatrosses are popular birds for birdwatchers and their colonies popular destinations for
ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are taken out of many costal towns and cities, like
Monterey, Kaikoura, Wollongong and Sydney, to see pelagic seabirds, and albatrosses are easily
attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil into the sea. Visits to
colonies can be very popular; the Northern Royal Albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand
attracts 40,000 visitors a year,[8] and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises
to sub-Antarctic islands.

 Threats and conservation
===============================


In spite of often being accorded legendary status, albatrosses have not escaped either indirect or
direct pressure from humans. Early encounters with albatrosses by Polynesians and Aleut Indians
resulted in hunting and in some cases extirpation from some islands (such as Easter Island). As
Europeans began sailing the world, they too began to hunt albatross, "fishing" for them from boats
to serve at the table or blasting them for sport.[29] This sport reached its peak on emigration
lines bound for Australia, and only died down when ships became too fast to fish from, and
regulations stopped the discharge of weapons for safety reasons. In the 19th century, albatross
colonies, particularly those in the North Pacific, were harvested for the feather trade, leading
to the near extinction of the Short-tailed Albatross.

This Black-browed Albatross has been hooked on a long-line.



Of the 21 albatross species recognised by IUCN on their Red List, 19 are threatened, and the other
two are near threatened.[30] Two species (as recognised by the IUCN) are considered critically
endangered: the Amsterdam Albatross and the Chatham Albatross. One of the main threats is
commercial long-line fishing,[31] as the albatrosses and other seabirds which will readily feed on
offal are attracted to the set bait become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 100,000
albatross per year are killed in this fashion. Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem.

Another threat to albatrosses is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly
attack the albatross or its chicks and eggs. Albatrosses have evolved to breed on islands where
land mammals are absent and have not evolved defences against them. Even species as small as mice
can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan Albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive
by introduced house mice that are almost 300 times smaller than they are.[32] Introduced species
can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island threatening
the Amsterdam Albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.

The remains of this Laysan Albatross chick show the plastic ingested prior to death, including a
bottle cap and lighter.



Ingestion of plastic flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic
in the seas has increased dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste
discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is
impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that should be used for food, or
can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific
have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition.[33]
This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan Albatross chicks on
Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy
chicks killed in accidents.[34] While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes
physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake
and the chances of survival.

Scientists and conservationists (most importantly BirdLife International and their partners, who
run the Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions
to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the
bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird
scarers can all reduce the seabird by-catch.[35] For example, a collaborative study between
scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for
long-liners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species.[36] The use of
some of these techniques in the Patagonian Toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to
have reduced the number of Black-browed Albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years.[37]
Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species
that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.

One important step towards protecting albatrosses and other seabirds is the 2001 treaty the
Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 and has
been ratified by eight countries, Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, France,
Peru and the United Kingdom. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to
reduce by-catch, pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands. The treaty has
also been signed but not ratified by another three countries, Argentina, Brazil and Chile.

 Species
==============


Current thinking divides the albatrosses into four genera. The number of species is a matter of
some debate. The IUCN and BirdLife International among others recognise the interim taxonomy of 21
extant species, other authorities retain the more traditional 14 species, and one recent paper
proposed a reduction to 13:

  o Wandering Albatross D. exulans
  o Antipodean Albatross D. (exulans) antipodensis
  o Amsterdam Albatross D. (exulans) amsterdamensis

  o Northern Royal Albatross D. (epomorpha) sanfordi
  o Southern Royal Albatross D. epomophora

* North Pacific albatrosses (Phoebastria)
  o Waved Albatross P. irrorata
