Spiders are predatory invertebrate animals that have two body segments, eight legs, no chewing
mouth parts and no wings. They are classified in the order Araneae, one of several orders within
the larger class of arachnids, a group which also contains scorpions, whip scorpions, mites,
ticks, and opiliones (harvestmen). The study of spiders is known as arachnology.

All spiders produce silk, a thin, strong protein strand extruded by the spider from spinnerets
most commonly found on the end of the abdomen. Many species use it to trap insects in webs,
although there are many species that hunt freely. Silk can be used to aid in climbing, form smooth
walls for burrows, build egg sacs, wrap prey, and temporarily hold sperm, among other applications.

All spiders except those in the families Uloboridae and Holarchaeidae, and in the suborder
Mesothelae (together about 350 species) can inject venom to protect themselves or to kill and
liquefy prey. Only about 200 species, however, have bites that can pose health problems to
humans.[1] Many larger species' bites may be painful, but will not produce lasting health concerns.

Spiders are found all over the world, from the tropics to the Arctic, living underwater in silken
domes they supply with air, and on the tops of mountains. In 1973 Skylab 3 took 2 spiders into
space to test their web-spinning capability in zero-gravity.

 Morphology
=================

Spider anatomy:
(1) four pairs of legs
(2) cephalothorax
(3) opisthosoma



Spiders, unlike insects, have only two body segments (tagmata) instead of three: a fused head and
thorax (called a cephalothorax or prosoma) and an abdomen (called the opisthosoma). The exception
to this rule are the assassin spiders, whose cephalothorax seems to be almost divided into two
independent units. Except for a few species of very primitive spiders (family Liphistiidae), the
abdomen is not externally segmented. The abdomen and cephalothorax are connected with a thin waist
called the pedicle or the pregenital somite, a trait that allows the spider to move the abdomen in
all directions. This waist is actually the last segment (somite) of the cephalothorax and is lost
in most other members of the Arachnida (in scorpions it is only detectable in the embryos).

 Cephalothorax
====================


All spiders have eight legs, although a few ant-mimicking species use their front legs to imitate
antennae, which spiders lack. Their eyes are single lenses rather than compound eyes, ranging from
simple light/dark-receptors to eyes rivaling that of a pigeon (some jumping spiders).

They have pedipalps (or just palps), at the base of which are coxae or maxillae next to their
mouth that aid in ingesting food; the ends of the palp are modified in adult males into elaborate
and often species-specific structures used for mating. Since they don't have any antennae, they
use specialised and sensitive hairs on their legs to pick up scent, sounds, vibrations and air
currents.

Spiders lack the ability to chew their food. Instead, like other arachnids, they have a tiny
proboscis which they use to suck up the liquid parts of their prey. However, they are able to eat
their own silk.

 Sense organs
===================

Multiple eyes of the jumping spider Platycryptus undatus



Spiders usually have eight eyes in various arrangements, a fact which is used to aid in
taxonomically classifying different species. Most species of the Haplogynae have six eyes,
although some have eight (Plectreuridae), four (eg., Tetrablemma) or even two (most Caponiidae)
eyes. Sometimes one pair of eyes is better developed than the rest, or even, in some cave species,
there are no eyes at all. Several families of hunting spiders, such as jumping spiders and wolf
spiders, have fair to excellent vision. The main pair of eyes in jumping spiders even see in color.

Net-casting spiders have enormous, compound lenses that give a wide field of view and gather
available light very efficiently.

However, most spiders that lurk on flowers, webs, and other fixed locations waiting for prey tend
to have very poor eyesight; instead they possess an extreme sensitivity to vibrations, which aids
in prey capture. Vibration sensitive spiders can sense vibrations from such various mediums as the
water surface, the soil or their silk threads. Also changes in the air pressure can be detected in
the search for prey.

 Respiration and circulation
==================================

Rear side of a spider



Spiders have an open circulatory system; i.e., they do not have true blood, or veins to convey it.
Rather, their bodies are filled with haemolymph, which is pumped through arteries by a heart into
spaces called sinuses surrounding their internal organs.

Spiders have developed several different respiratory anatomies, based either on book lungs, a
tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have two pairs of book lungs filled
with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and
diffuse oxygen. This is also the case for some basal araneomorph spiders like the family
Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs
intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae,
through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. This
system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were
originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of spiracles, but in the majority of
spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and migrated posterior
close to the spinnerets.

Among smaller araneomorph spiders we can find species who have evolved also the anterior pair of
book lungs into trachea, or the remaining book lungs are simply reduced or missing, and in a very
few the book lungs have developed deep channels, apparently signs of evolution into tracheae. Some
very small spiders in moist and sheltered habitats have no breathing organs at all, and instead
breathe directly through their body surface. In the tracheal system, oxygen interchange is much
more efficient, enabling cursorial hunting (hunting involving extended pursuit) and other advanced
characteristics as having a smaller heart and the ability to live in drier habitats.

 Digestion
================

Digestion is carried out internally and externally. Spiders that do not have powerful chelicerae
secrete digestive fluids into their prey from a series of ducts perforating their chelicerae.
These digestive fluids dissolve the prey's internal tissues. Then the spider feeds by sucking the
partially digested fluids out. Other spiders with more powerfully built chelicerae masticate the
entire body of their prey and leave behind only a relatively small residue of indigestible
materials. Spiders consume only liquid foods. Many spiders will store prey temporarily. Web
weaving spiders that have made a shroud of silk to quiet their envenomed prey's death struggles
will generally leave them in these shrouds and then consume them at their leisure.

Spiders are capable of digesting their own silk, so some spiders may eat their used webs. When a
spider drops down on a single strand of silk and then returns, it will generally rapidly consume
the strand of silk on its way back up.

 Spinnerets
=================


The abdomen has no appendages except from one to four (usually three) modified pairs of movable
telescoping organs called spinnerets, which produce silk. The suborder Mesothelae is unique in
having only two types of silk glands - thought to be the ancestral condition. All other spiders
have the spinnerets further towards the posterior end of the body where they form a small cluster,
and the anterior central spinnerets on the tenth segment are lost or reduced (suborder
Mygalomorphae), or modified into a specialised and flattened plate called the cribellum (parts of
suborder Araneomorphae), which produces a thread made up of hundreds to thousands of very fine dry
silk fibers resulting in a woolly structure that traps prey. The cribellate spiders were the first
spiders to build specialized prey catching webs. Later some groups evolved (called ecribellate)
that use silk threads dotted with sticky droplets to capture prey ranging from small arthropods to
sometimes even small bats and birds.

 Size
===========


Spiders occur in a large range of sizes. The smallest (members of the subfamily Micryphantinae)
are less than 1 mm. long (i.e., less than about .05 inches) in body length. The largest and
heaviest spiders occur among the tarantulas, which can have body lengths as great as 9 cm. (i.e.,
about 3.5 inches) and leg spans as great as 25 cm. (i.e., about 10 inches).[2]

 Coloration
=================


Only three classes of pigment (ommochromes, bilins and guanine) have been identified in spiders,
although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized. Melanins, carotenoids and
pterins, very common in other animals, are apparently absent. In some species the exocuticle of
the legs and prosoma is modified by a tanning process, resulting in brown coloration.[3]

Bilins are found for example in Micrommata virescens, resulting in its green color. Guanine is
responsible for the white markings of the European garden spider Araneus diadematus. It is in many
species accumulated in specialized cells called guanocytes. In genera such as Tetragnatha,
Leucauge, Argyrodes or Theridiosoma, guanine creates their silvery appearance. While guanine is
originally an end-product of protein metabolism, its excretion can be blocked in spiders, leading
to an increase in its storage.[3]

Structural colors occur in some species, which are the result of the diffraction, scattering or
interference of light, for example by modified setae or scales. The white prosoma of Argiope
results from hairs reflecting the light, Lycosa and Josa both have areas of modified cuticle that
act as light reflectors.[3]

 Life Cycle
=================


The spider life cycle progresses through three stages: the embryonic, the larval, and the
nympho-imaginal.

The time between when an egg is fertilized and when the spider begins to take the shape of an
adult spider is referred to as the embryonic stage. As the spider enters the larval stage, it
begins to look more and more like a full grown spider. It enters the larval stage as a prelarva
and, through subsequent moults, reaches its larval form, a spider-shaped animal feeding off its
yolk supply. After a few more moults (also called instars) body structures become differentiated.
Soon, all organ systems are complete and the animal begins to hunt on its own; it has reached the
nympho-imaginal stage.[4]

This stage is differentiated into two sub-stages: the nymph, or juvenile stage and the imago, or
adult stage. A spider does not become sexually mature until it makes the transition from nymph to
imago.[4] Once a spider has reached the imago stage, it will remain there until its death. After
sexual maturity is reached, the general rule is that they stop moulting, but the females of some
non-araneomorph species will continue to moult the rest of their lives.

 Lifespan
===============


Many spiders may only live for about a year, but a number will live two years or more,
overwintering in sheltered areas. The annual influx of 'outdoor' spiders into houses in the fall
is due to this search for a warm place to spend the winter. It is common for tarantulas to live
around twenty years.

 Reproduction
===================


Spiders reproduce by means of eggs, which are packed into silk bundles called egg sacs. Spiders
often use elaborate mating rituals (especially the visually advanced jumping spiders) to allow
conspecifics to identify each other and to allow the male to approach and inseminate the female
without triggering a predatory response. If the approach signals are exchanged correctly, the male
spider must (in most cases) make a timely departure after mating to escape before the female's
normal predatory instincts return.

Sperm transmission from male to female occurs indirectly. When a male is ready to mate, he spins a
web pad upon which he discharges his seminal fluid. He then dips his pedipalps (also known as
palpi), the small, leg-like appendages on the front of his cephalothorax, into the seminal fluid,
picking it up by capillary attraction. Mature male spiders have swollen bulbs on the end of their
palps for this purpose, and this is a useful way to identify the sex of a spider in the field.
With his palps thus charged he goes off in search of a female. Copulation occurs when the male
inserts one or both palps into the female's genital opening, known as the epigyne. He transfers
his seminal fluid into the female by expanding the sinuses in his palp. Once the sperm is inside
her, she stores it in a chamber and only uses it during the egg-laying process, when the eggs
comes into contact with the male sperm for the first time and are fertilized; this may be why the
vivipary has never evolved in spiders.

Very unusual behaviour is seen in spiders of the genus Tidarren: the male amputates one of his
palps before maturation and enters his adult life with one palp only. The palpi constitute 20% of
the body mass of males of this species, and since this weight greatly impedes its movement, by
detaching one of the two he gains increased mobility. In the Yemeni species Tidarren argo, the
remaining palp is then torn off by the female. The separated palp remains attached to the female's
epigynum for about four hours and apparently continues to function independently. In the meantime
the female feeds on the palpless male.[5]

 Sacrificial males
========================



        Main article: Spider cannibalism

It is a common belief that male spiders, which usually are significantly smaller than the females,
are likely to be killed after or during mating, or sometimes even before mating can occur.

Even in some species of black widow, which are named exactly for this belief, the male may live in
the female's web for some time without being harmed. However, the male of the closely related
Australian redback spider is killed ritually by the females after it inserts its second palpus in
the female genital opening; in over 60% of cases the female then eats the male.[6] Males that
'sacrifice' themselves gain the benefit of increasing their paternity relative to males who do not
get cannibalized, by feeding the egg-laying female.

In many other species, males are sometimes killed by females. In at least some of these cases it's
likely that the males are simply mistaken as prey.

 Ecology
==============


Spiders have a great range of variation and lifestyle, although all are predatory.

While spiders are generalist predators, in actuality their different methods of prey capture often
determine the type of prey taken. Thus web-building spiders rarely capture caterpillars, and crab
spiders that ambush prey in flowers capture more bees, butterflies and some flies than other
insects. Groups of families that tend to take certain types of prey because of their prey capture
methods are often called guilds. A few spiders are more specialized in their prey capture. Dysdera
captures and eats sowbugs, pillbugs and beetles, while pirate spiders eat only other spiders.
Bolas spiders in the family Araneidae use sex pheromone analogs to capture only the males of
certain moth species. Despite their generally broad prey ranges, spiders are one of the most
important links in the regulation of the populations of insects.

 Behavior
===============


Spiders show a wide variety of behavior, from the ballet-like mating dances of certain jumping
spiders to the seeming athletics of bolas spiders snatching their prey. Most diversity comes with
the mode of predation, for example whether the spider waits for it in its orb web, or hunts it
down.

 Predatory techniques
===========================



        Main article: Spider diversity

A spider hiding in its leaf (located at the center of its web)



There are many families of spiders, and the ways that they catch prey are diverse. But whether
they catch insects, fish, small mammals, small birds, or some other small form of life, as soon as
a spider makes contact with its prey it will generally attempt to bite it.

Spiders bite their prey, and occasionally animals that cause them pain or threaten them, to do two
things. First, they inflict mechanical damage, which, in the case of a spider that is as large as
or larger than its prey, can be severe. Second, they can choose to inject venom through their
hollow fangs. Many genera, such as the widow spiders, inject neurotoxins that can spread through
the prey's entire body and interfere with vital body functions. Other genera inject venom that
operates to produce tissue damage at the site of the bite. Genera such as that of the brown
recluse spider produce a necrotoxin. The necrotoxin is injected into prey where it causes the
degradation of cell membranes. In the larger victims that do not die from these attacks, painful
lesions over a fairly wide area of the body can remain active for fairly long periods of time. The
spitting spiders have modified their poison glands to produce a mixture of venom and sticky
substance that works as glue and immobilises the prey.

Although there are no vegetarian spiders, some species in the families Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae,
Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae have been observed feeding on plant nectar.[7] Several
spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages in
captivity.[7]

 Spider webs
==================



        Main article: Spider web

Having completed its web, a spider in the forests of Malaysia awaits its prey. Appears to be some
species of Nephila.

A golden silk orb-weaver (Nephila clavipes?), member of the family Nephilidae.



Some spiders spin funnel-shaped webs, others make sheet webs, spiders like the black widow make
tangled, maze-like, webs, and still others make the spiral "orb" webs that are most commonly
associated with spiders. These webs may be made with sticky capture silk, or with "fluffy" capture
silk, depending on the type of spider. Webs may be in a vertical plane (most orb webs), a
horizontal plane (sheet webs), or at any angle in between. Most commonly found in the sheet-web
spider families, some webs will have loose, irregular tangles of silk above them. These tangled
obstacle courses serve to disorient and knock down flying insects, making them more vulnerable to
being trapped on the web below. They may also help to protect the spider from aerial predators
such as birds and wasps.

The spider, after spinning its web, will then wait on, or near, the web for a prey animal to
become trapped. The spider can sense the impact and struggle of a prey animal by vibrations
transmitted along the web lines.

Other species of spiders do not use webs for capturing prey directly, instead pouncing from
concealment (e.g. trapdoor spiders) or running them down in open chase (e.g. wolf spiders). The
net-casting spider balances the two methods of running and web-spinning in its feeding habits.
This spider weaves a small net which it attaches to its front legs. It then lurks in wait for
potential prey and, when such prey arrives, lunges forward to wrap its victim in the net, bite and
paralyze it. Hence, this spider expends less energy catching prey than a primitive hunter such as
the Wolf spider. It also avoids the energy cost of weaving a large orb-web. The diving bell spider
does not use its web directly in prey capture, but has modified it into an underwater diving bell.
Even species whose ancestors were building spiral orb webs have given rise to spiders who no
longer make webs, for instance some Hawaiian spiny-legged spiders (genus Tetragnatha, family
Tetragnathidae) which have abandoned web construction entirely.

Some spiders manage to use the 'signaling snare' technique of a web without spinning a web at all.
Several types of water-dwelling spiders will rest their feet on the water's surface in much the
same manner as an orb-web user. When an insect falls onto the water and is ensnared by surface
tension, the spider can detect the vibrations and run out to capture the prey.

 Hunting spiders
======================

Many spiders do not build webs for catching prey. Some examples include:

* Brazilian wandering spider
* Brown recluse spider
* Huntsman spiders
* Jumping spiders
* Lynx spiders
* Nursery web spiders
* Spitting spiders
* Tarantulas
* Wolf spiders (Lycosidae)
* Yellow sac spider
* Assassin spider

 Ambush predators
=======================


Some actively lure prey (the Bolas spiders) and may capture them with a sticky ball of silk on a
line; others (like the crab spiders, trapdoor spiders, or the six-eyed sand spider) wait in a
high-traffic area and directly attack their prey from ambush.

 Defense
==============


All spiders will attempt to protect themselves by biting, especially if they are unable to flee.
Some tarantulas have a second kind of defense, a patch of urticating hairs, or urticating setae,
on their abdomens, which is generally absent on modern spiders and Mesothelae. These ultra-fine
hairs causes irritation and sometimes even allergic reactions in the attacker. Certain other
species have specialized defense tactics. For example, the golden wheeling spider (Carparachne
aureoflava) of the desert of Namibia escapes tarantula hawks (a species of wasp that lays its eggs
in a paralyzed spider so the larvae have enough food when they hatch) by flipping onto its side
and cartwheeling away.

 Social spiders
=====================


A few species of spiders that build webs live together in large colonies and show social behavior,
albeit not as well evolved as in social insects. The most social species is probably Anelosimus
eximius, which can form colonies of up to fifty thousand individuals.

 Web types
================

 Tangleweb spiders
========================


Members of this group (family Theridiidae) are characterized by irregular, messy-looking, tangled,
three-dimensional (non-sticky) webs, generally low and anchored to the ground or floor and wall.
They are commonly found in or near buildings; some build webs in bushes. The spider generally
hangs in the center of its web, upside-down. Prey is generally ground-dwelling insects such as
ants or crickets, in addition to small flying insects. These include the infamous black widows,
the minute happyface spider, and thousands of other species.

 Orb web spiders
======================

Nephila clavata, a golden orb weaver



Spiders in several families (eg., Araneidae, Tetragnathidae, Nephilidae) spin the familiar spiral
snare that most people think of as the typical spider web. On average, an orb-weaving spider takes
30 minutes to an hour to weave a web. They range in size from quite large (6+?cm) to very small
(<1?cm), but all are quite harmless to humans, beyond the shock entailed from walking into a
face-height web and having a large spider dangling from your nose. Many of the daytime hunters
have a 'ferocious' appearance, with spines or large 'fangs', but they are almost invariably
inoffensive, preferring to drop on a dragline to the ground when disturbed, rather than bite,
which can nevertheless be quite painful.

 Other forms of webs
==========================


Many other groups spin webs in a variety of structural styles.

Some (the Linyphiidae) make various forms of bowl- or dome-shaped webs with or without a flat
sheet or a tangled web above or below. Some make a flat platform extending from a funnel-shaped
retreat, with generally a tangle of silk above the web. The common northern hemisphere
'funnel-web', 'house' or 'grass' spiders are only superficially similar to the notorious Sydney
funnel-web spider, and are generally considered to be quite harmless. Some of the more primitive
group Atypidae may make tubular webs up the base of trees, from inside which they bite insects
that land on the webbing. These spiders look quite ferocious, but are not generally considered to
be particularly dangerous to humans.

 Evolution
================



        Main article: Spider evolution

Trigonotarbids, spider-like arachnids, were among the oldest known land arthropods. Like spiders,
they were terrestrial, respired through book lungs, and walked on eight legs with two additional
legs adapted to use around their mouth. However, they were not true spiders, not even ancestral to
them, but represented independent offshoots of the Arachnida.

True spiders (thin-waisted arachnids) evolved about 400 million years ago, and were among the
first species to live on land. They are distinguished by abdominal segmentation and silk producing
spinnerets. The Pedipalpi (including whip scorpions) are believed to constitute the sister group
to the Araneae.[8]

Most of the early segmented fossil spiders belonged to the Mesothelae, a group of primitive
spiders with the spinnerets placed underneath the middle of the abdomen, rather than at the end as
in modern spiders (Opisthothelae). They were probably ground dwelling predators of other primitive
arthropods. Silk may have been used simply as a protective covering for the eggs, a lining for a
retreat hole, and later perhaps for simple ground sheet web and trapdoor construction.

As plant and insect life diversified so also did the spider's use of silk. Spiders with spinnerets
at the end of the abdomen (Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae) appeared more than 250 million years
ago, presumably promoting the development of more elaborate sheet and maze webs for prey capture
both on ground and foliage, as well as the development of the safety dragline.

By the Jurassic, the sophisticated aerial webs of the orb weaving spiders had already developed to
take advantage of the rapidly diversifying groups of insects. A spider web preserved in amber,
thought to be 110 million years old, shows evidence of a perfect orb web.] It is believed that
adhesive capture threads, as opposed to cribellate threads, evolved about 135 million years ago.[9]

The ability to weave orb webs is thought to have been "lost", and sometimes even re-evolved or
evolved separately, in different breeds of spiders since its first appearance.

 Taxonomy
===============



        Main article: Spider taxonomy

Deinopis_subrufa



Almost 40,000 species of spiders (order Araneae) have been identified and are currently grouped
into 111 families by arachnologists, but because of difficulties in collecting these often very
minute and evasive animals, and because of many specimens stored in collections waiting to be
described and classified, it is believed that up to 200,000 species may exist.

The order is composed of three suborders. In the non-venomous primitive Mesothelae, body
segmentation is clearly visible, demonstrating the link of spiders with their segmented arthropod
ancestors.

The two other suborders, the Mygalomorphae (trapdoor spiders, funnel-web spiders, tarantulas) and
the Araneomorphae ("modern" spiders), are sometimes grouped together as Opisthothelae. The latter
account for about 94% of all spider species.

 Mesothelae
=================



        Main article: Mesothelae

Liphistius sp.

The tarantula Brachypelma smithi



The Mesothelae include the only recent family Liphistiidae. Two more families (Arthrolycosidae and
Arthromygalidae) are recognized from fossil evidence only.

The Liphistiidae are burrowing spiders only found in Southeast Asia, China, and Japan with about
90 species in 5 genera. Spiders of this remnant suborder are very rare, and are among the most
"primitive" types of spiders in existence.

Recent Mesothelae are characterized by the narrow sternum on the ventral side of the prosoma.
Several plesiomorphic characters may be useful in recognizing these spiders: there are tergite
plates on the dorsal side and the almost-median position of the spinnerets on the ventral side of
the opisthosoma.

 Mygalomorphae
====================



        Main article: Mygalomorphae

The Mygalomorphae are also called the Orthognatha, referring to the orientation of the fangs which
point straight down and do not cross each other (cf Araneomorphae). This suborder includes the
heavy bodied, stout legged spiders popularly known as tarantulas as well as the dangerous
Australasian funnel-web spiders. They have ample poison glands that lie entirely within their
chelicerae. Their chelicerae and fangs are large and powerful. Occasionally members of this
suborder will even kill small fish, small mammals, etc. Most members of this suborder occur in the
tropics and subtropics, but their range can extend farther toward the poles, e.g. into the
southern and western regions of the United States and Canada, the northern parts of Europe and
south into Argentina and Chile.

 Araneomorphae
====================



        Main article: Araneomorphae

The Araneomorphae, (previously called the Labidognatha), are often known as the modern spiders.

They are distinguished by having chelicerae that point diagonally forward and cross in a pinching
action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), where they point
straight down. Most of the spiders that people encounter in daily life belong to this suborder,
which makes up 94% of all spider species.

There are approximately 95 families in this suborder, ranging from the minute Patu digua (0.37?mm)
to the big and flashy Argiope, from the common orb-weaver spiders to the abstruse assassin
spiders, from the reclusive tree trapdoor spiders to the inquisitive jumping spiders.

 Creatures often mistaken for spiders
===========================================

Araneus diadematus



In addition to the true spiders, there are several arachnids commonly mistaken for spiders, but
which are not true spiders.

* Camel spider, a species of solifugid (also commonly called sun-spiders or wind-scorpions), are
  the source of many urban legends. In spite of their bad reputation they are actually harmless to
  humans, and have no venom.
* The daddy long-legs or harvestman is a member of the order Opiliones. These round-bodied
  arachnids have only two eyes and their heads are fused to their bodies. However, the name "daddy
  long-legs" is sometimes used to refer to cellar spiders, which have a similar leg shape; these
  are true spiders. Both are also often said to produce a deadly venom. While the harvestmen do
  not produce venom at all, the cellar spider's venom is completely harmless to humans.

 Spiders and people
=========================

 Spider bites
===================

Sydney funnel-web spider

        Main article: Spider bite

Most spiders are unlikely to bite humans because they do not identify humans as prey. Spiders,
even small ones, may however bite humans when pinched. For instance, a common jumping spider
(Family: Salticidae), around ⅜?inch (1?cm) long, when pinched between the folds of a human's
palm may inflict a bite that is about as painful as a bee sting.

Spiders in the world which have been linked to fatalities in humans, or have been shown to have
potentially fatal bites by toxicology studies of their venom, include:

* The Brazilian wandering spider
* The Australasian funnel-web spider
* The widow spiders, including the Australian redback spider
* The six-eyed sand spider, and possibly other spiders of genus Sicarius
* The recluse spiders

Spiders which likely are not deadly to humans, but which are nonetheless medically significant
include:

* The hobo spider (this is doubtful, however)
* The yellow sac spider
* Certain species of tarantulas
* The false black widows

Spiders which can inflict painful bites (often similar to a bee sting), but whose bites generally
do not cause any systemic or long-lasting effects, include:

* The huntsman spider
* The redback jumping spider (not to be confused with the very dangerous redback spider, the
  latter being one of the widow spiders).

None of these spiders will intentionally "come after you," but they should be removed from one's
house to avoid accidental injury. Many authorities warn against spraying poisons indiscriminately
to kill all spiders, because doing so may actually remove one of the biological controls against
incursions of the more dangerous species by ridding them of their competition.

If dangerous spiders are present in your area, be mindful when moving cardboard boxes and other
such objects that may have become the shelter of a venomous spider. There is no need to be
fearful; just do not grab a spider.

 Spiders as food
======================


Spiders, especially larger sorts, are eaten routinely or as a delicacy in various parts of the

Arachnophobia is a specific phobia, an abnormal fear of spiders. It is among the most common of
phobias. The reactions of arachnophobics often seem irrational to others (and sometimes to the
sufferers themselves). People with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe
could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such as webs. If they see a
spider they may not enter the general vicinity until they overcome the panic attack that is often
associated with their phobia. They may feel humiliated if such episodes happen in the presence of
peers or family members. The fear of spiders can be treated by any of general techniques suggested
for specific phobias.

Arachnophobia is also the title of a 1990 film, as well as a spin-off video game, in which
(fictitious) deadly spiders overrun a small California town.

 Spiders in symbolism and culture
=======================================



        Main article: Spiders in culture

There are many references to the spider in popular culture, folklore and symbolism. The spider
symbolizes patience for its hunting with web traps, and mischief and malice for its poison and the
slow death this causes. It symbolizes possessiveness for its spinning its prey into a ball and
taking it to its burrow (for burrowing species).
