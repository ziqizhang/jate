Domesticated



Kingdom: Animalia

Phylum: Chordata

Class: Aves

Order: Galliformes

Family: Phasianidae

Genus: Gallus

Species: G. gallus



A chicken (Gallus gallus) is a type of domesticated bird which is often raised as a type of
poultry. It is believed to be descended from the wild Indian and south-east Asian Red Junglefowl.

With a population of more than 24 billion in 2003,[1] there are more chickens in the world than
any other bird. They provide two sources of food frequently consumed by humans: their meat, and
their eggs.

General biology and habitat
===========================

Chicken eggs vary in color depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of
brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) (Araucana
varieties).

Rooster crowing during daylight hours



Male chickens are known as roosters (in the U.S., Canada and Australia), cocks, or cockerels.
Castrated roosters are called capons. Female chickens are known as hens, or 'chooks' in Australian
English. Young females are known as pullets. Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by
their striking plumage, marked by long flowing tails and bright pointed feathers on their necks.

However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright, the cock only has slightly pointed neck feathers,
and the identification must be made by looking at the comb. Chickens have a fleshy crest on their
heads called a comb or cockscomb, and a fleshy piece of hanging skin under their beak called a
wattle. These organs help to cool the bird by redirecting blood flow to the skin. Both the male
and female have distinctive wattles and combs. In males, the combs are often more prominent,
though this is not the case in all varieties.

Domestic chickens are typically fed commercially prepared feed that includes a protein source as
well as grains. Chickens often scratch at the soil to get at adult insects and larvae or seed.
Incidents of cannibalism can occur when a curious bird pecks at a preexisting wound or during
fighting (even among female birds). This is exacerbated in close quarters. In commercial egg and
meat production this is controlled by trimming the beak (removal of ⅔ of the top half and
occasionally ⅓ of the lower half of the beak).

Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although they are generally capable of
flying for short distances such as over fences. Chickens will sometimes fly to explore their
surroundings, but usually only to flee perceived danger. Because of flight risk, chickens raised
in open-air pens generally have one of their wings clipped by the breeder — the tips of the
longest feathers on one of the wings are cut, resulting in unbalanced flight which the bird cannot
sustain for more than a few meters (more on wing clipping).

Chickens are gregarious birds and live together as a flock. They have a communal approach to the
incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
establishing a "pecking order," with dominant individuals having priority for access to food and
nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
social order until a new pecking order is established.

Chickens will try to lay in nests that already contain eggs, and have been known to move eggs from
neighbouring nests into their own. Some farmers use fake eggs made from plastic or stone to
encourage hens to lay in a particular location. The result of this behavior is that a flock will
use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.

Hens can also be extremely stubborn about always laying in the same location. It is not unknown
for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or
one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of
each other.

Contrary to popular belief, roosters do not crow only at dawn, but may crow at any time of the day
or night. Their crowing - a loud and sometimes shrill call - is a territorial signal to other
roosters. However, crowing may also result from sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

Recent studies [1] have shown that chickens (and possibly other bird species) still retain the
genetic blueprints to produce teeth in the jaws, although these are dormant in living animals.
These are a holdover from primitive birds such as Archaeopteryx, which were descended from
theropod dinosaurs. (It has been suggested that chickens are related to Tyrannosaurus rex. [2])

Courting
========

When a rooster finds food he may call the other chickens to eat it first. He does this by clucking
in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behavior can also be observed in
mother hens, calling their chicks. In some cases the rooster will drag the wing opposite the hen
on the ground, while circling her. This is part of chicken courting ritual. When a hen is used to
coming to his "call" the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the fertilization.

Going broody
============

Sometimes a hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of eggs, a state that is
commonly known as going broody. A broody chicken will sit fast on the nest, and protest or peck in
defense if disturbed or removed, and will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust bathe.
While brooding, the hen maintains constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs
regularly.

At the end of the incubation period, which is an average of 21 days, the eggs (if fertilized) will
hatch, and the broody hen will take care of her young. Since individual eggs do not all hatch at
exactly the same time (the chicken can only lay one egg approximately every 25 hours), the hen
will usually stay on the nest for about two days after the first egg hatches. During this time,
the newly-hatched chicks live off the egg yolk they absorb just before hatching. The hen can sense
the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their
shells. If the eggs are not fertilized by a rooster and do not hatch, the hen will eventually lose
interest and leave the nest.

Modern egg-laying breeds rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the
incubation cycle. Some breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, regularly go broody and
make excellent maternal figures. Chickens used in this capacity are known as utility chickens.

Artificial incubation
=====================


Chicken egg incubation can successfully occur artificially as well. Nearly all chicken eggs will
hatch after 21 days of good conditions - 99.5 °F (37.5°C) and around 55% relative humidity
(increase to 70% in the last three days of incubation to help soften egg shell). Many commercial
incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with
rotation of the eggs a fully automated process.

Home incubators are usually small boxes (styrofoam incubators are popular) and hold a few to 50
eggs. Eggs must be turned three to five times each day, rotating at least 90 degrees. If eggs
aren't turned, the embryo inside will stick to the shell and likely will be hatched with physical
defects. This process is natural; hens will stand up three to five times a day and shift the eggs
around with their beak.

Chickens as food
================

Roast Chicken

        Main article: Chicken (food)

The meat of the chicken, also called "chicken," is a type of poultry. Because of its relatively
low cost among meats, chicken is one of the most used meats in the world. Nearly all parts of the
bird can be used for food, and the meat is cooked in many different ways around the world. Popular
chicken dishes include fried chicken, chicken soup, marinated chicken wings, tandoori chicken,
butter chicken, and chicken rice. Chicken is also a staple of fast food restaurants such as KFC
(most products), McDonald's (chicken sandwiches/burgers, chicken nuggets) and Burger King. Chicken
has a fairly neutral flavour and texture, and is used as a reference point for describing other
foods; many are said to 'taste like chicken' if they are indistinctive.

Chickens as pets
================

Chickens can make good companion animals, but can sometimes become aggressive. Some have advised
against keeping certain breeds around young children], as the chickens can become territorial and
violent. In Asia, chickens with striking plumage have long been kept for ornamental purposes,
including feather-footed varieties such as the Cochin from Vietnam and Silkie from China and the
extremely long-tailed Phoenix from Japan. Asian ornamental varieties were imported into the United
States and Great Britain in the late 1800s. Distinctive American varieties of chickens have been
developed from these Asian breeds. Poultry fanciers began keeping these ornamental birds for
exhibition, a practice that continues today.

While some cities in the United States still allow chickens as pets, the practice is quickly
disappearing.] Individuals in rural communities commonly keep chickens for both ornamental and
practical value. Some communities ban only roosters, allowing the quieter hens. Many zoos use
chickens instead of insecticides to control insect populations.

Keeping a few chickens as backyard pets is surprisingly easy to do. The major challenge is
protecting the birds from predators such as dogs, raccoons and foxes. The birds will need a secure
place to sleep at night. This can be as simple or as elaborate as you like. For a few birds
allowed to roam free during the day, a large doghouse-type structure with a locking door will
serve just fine. Some kind of bedding such as straw or wood shavings should be provided on the
floor. Nest boxes will make egg collection easier. If the birds are left in the structure during
the day, a larger, more elaborate structure would be necessary.

Chickens naturally return to the same spot to roost every night. On most occasions they will put
themselves to bed and your only job would be to make sure the door is shut and locked before
nightfall. It is best to count the birds each night as sometimes a bird will not find his or her
way back into the coop. A bird left out at night is likely to be killed by a predator.

Most chickens cannot fly well and are easily contained with 3-4' fencing. Birds which are allowed
to roam the yard during the day are quite effective at controlling insects of all types. Areas of
bare dirt will benefit from the weed control and soil cultivation provided by the birds in their
never-ending search for food. The birds, however, will pick at plants and grass and may cause some
damage to ground-cover with their scratching. Also chickens will eat most any kind of food scraps.

The eggs themselves can be quite different from the store purchased variety. Fresh yolks are quite
"perky" and stand tall above the white. The yolk color is frequently a deeper color than the pale
yellow of commercially raised eggs and can at times be almost a dark orange.

Growing chickens can be tamed by feeding them a special treat (such as mealworms) by hand, and by
being with them for at least ten minutes daily when they are young. Even older birds can be tamed
considerably by hand-feeding leftover table scraps. It can be fun to help the birds forage by
turning rocks over and watching them grab worms and bugs that typically can be found in these
dark, moist areas. The chickens quickly associate you with a source of food and will become your
constant companion when you are both in the yard.

A former recurring skit on the weekly comedy show Saturday Night Live featured a chicken pet store
with the Chinese owner (as played by Dana Carvey) not wishing to sell to customers on the basis
that "Chickens make lousy house pets."

Free range chickens

In the United States, chickens were once raised primarily on family farms. Prior to about 1910,
chicken was served primarily on special occasions or on Saturday, as the birds were typically more
valued for their eggs than meat. As cities developed and markets sprung up across the nation, live
chickens from local farms could often be seen for sale in crates outside the market to be
butchered and cleaned onsite by the butcher. Some people still keep "free range" chickens for
personal use, and may even sell the eggs and meat, but very few are raised on a large scale
commercial basis this way.

With the advent of vertical integration and selective breeding of efficient meat-type birds,
poultry production changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants emerged that could grow
birds by the thousands. Chickens could be sent to slaughterhouses for butchering and processing
into pre-packaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers.
Meat-type chickens currently grow to market weight in six to seven weeks whereas only fifty years
ago it took three times as long.[2] This is due exclusively to genetic selection and nutritional
modifications (and not the use of growth hormones, which are illegal for use in poultry in the US
and many other countries). Once a meat consumed only occasionally, the common availability and
lower cost has made chicken a common and significant meat product within developed nations.
Growing concerns over the cholesterol content of red meat in the 1980s and 1990s further resulted
in increased consumption of chicken.

Another breed of chicken, the Leghorn chicken, was further developed to be an efficient egg layer.
Egg production and consumption changed with the development of automation and refrigeration. Large
farms were devoted solely to egg production and packaging. Today, eggs are produced on large egg
ranches on which environmental parameters are well controlled. Chickens are exposed to artificial
light cycles to stimulate egg production year-round. In addition, it is a common practice to
induce molt through careful manipulation of light and the amount of food they receive in order to
further increase egg size and production.

On average, a chicken lays one egg a day; however, this varies with the breed and time of year.
For example, a Barred Plymouth Rock may lay one egg a day during the spring, summer and fall. But
the same chicken may not lay at all during the winter. However, a chicken bred specifically for
egg-laying may occasionally lay two eggs a day, and if housed correctly may lay all through the
winter. Usually, egg laying hens are butchered after their first egg laying period that usually
lasts from 12 to 14 months. The period begins when the hen is about 20 weeks old (depending on
breed and season). Since roosters are not needed in the egg industry, all the males (roughly fifty
percent of all chickens) are killed after their birth when producing birds for the egg industry.

Issues with mass production
===========================

Humane Treatment
================

Many animal welfare advocates object to killing chickens for food or to the "factory farm
conditions" under which they are raised. They contend that commercial chicken production usually
involves raising the birds in large, crowded rearing sheds that prevent the chickens from engaging
in many of their natural behaviors. Fast food giant KFC has been the target of PETA recently due
to its methods of keeping its 750 million plus chickens each year.

Chickens generally live five to eleven years depending on the breed [3]; chickens raised for meat
are slaughtered prior to sexual maturity (six weeks), and thus many of the aggressive behaviors
seen in adult chickens (fighting, cannibalism) are seldom seen in for-meat chickens. Both male and
female chicks have the ends of their beaks cut off, to reduce the risk of them injuring each other
in close quarters. Because beaks are sensitive, trimming them without anaesthesia is considered
inhumane by some. It is also argued that the procedure causes life-long discomfort.

When advocating more humane treatment of chickens, it is sometimes asserted that they are
intelligent. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, a trained chicken was shown playing "Mary Had a
Little Lamb" on a toy piano and bowled 3 strikes.] Animal welfare groups such as PETA regard such
cases as evidence that the birds are intelligent.[4] Dr. Chris Evans of Macquarie University
claims that their range of 20 calls, problem solving skills and the ability to recognise each
other by facial features demonstrate the intelligence of chickens, saying "As a trick at
conferences, I sometimes list these attributes, without mentioning chickens, and people think
I’m talking about monkeys." [5]

Another animal welfare issue is the use of selective breeding to create heavy, large-breasted
birds, which can lead to crippling leg disorders and heart failure for some of the birds. Concerns
have been raised that companies growing single varieties of bird for eggs or meat are increasing
their susceptiblity to disease. For this reason, many scientists are promoting the conservation of
heritage breeds to retain genetic diversity in the species.

In 2004, 8.9 billion chickens were slaughtered in the United States.[6]

Human Concerns
==============

Antibiotics
===========


Because raising chickens in close quarters fosters the spread of disease, factory farms use
antibiotics as a matter of course; many contend that this puts humans at risk as bacterial strains
develop stronger and stronger resistances.[7]

A proposed bill in the American congress would make the use of antibiotics in animal feed legal
only for therapeutic (rather than preventative) use, but it has not been passed yet. [8] Though
this will certainly solve one problem, it does not address the fact that bacteria continue to
develop resistances; hence, there is the risk of slaughtered chickens harboring these bacteria and
passing them on to the humans that consume them.

In October 2000, the FDA discovered that two antibiotics were no longer effective in treating
diseases found in factory-farmed chickens; one antibiotic was willingly and swiftly pulled from
the market, but the other, Baytril was not. Bayer, the company which produced it, contested the
claim and as a result, Baytril remained in use until July of 2005.[9]

Arsenic
=======


Chickens feed can also include Roxarsone, an antimicrobial drug that also promotes growth. The
drug has generated controversy because it contains the element arsenic, which can cause cancer,
dementia, and neurological problems in humans. Yet the arsenic in Roxarsone is not of the type
which has been linked to cancer. A Consumer Reports study in 2004 reported finding "no detectable
arsenic in our samples of muscle" but found "A few of our chicken-liver samples has an omount that
according to EPA standards could cause neurological problems in a child who ate 2 ounces of cooked
liver per week or in an adult who ate 5.5 ounces per week." However, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) not the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for the
regulation of foods and all samples tested were "far less than the... amount allowed in a food
product."[10]

Growth Hormones
===============


Chickens grow much more rapidly than they once did and some consumers have concluded that this
rapid growth is due to the use of hormones in these animals. Some consumers believe that the
increasingly earlier onset of puberty is the result of the liberal use of such hormones. However,
hormone use in poultry production is illegal in the United States.[3] No chicken meat for sale in
Australia is fed hormones. [4] Furthermore, several scientific studies have documented the fact
that chickens grow rapidly because they are bred to do so.[5][6] Perhaps a small producer of
natural and organic chickens said it best:

If this were 1948, you might have something to worry about. Using hormones to boost egg production
was a brief fad in the Forties, but was abandoned because it didn't work. Using hormones to
produce soft-meated roasters was used to some extent in the Forties and Fifties, but the increased
growth rates of broilers made the practice irrelevant--the broilers got as big as anyone wanted
them to get when they were still young enough to be soft-meated without chemicals. The only
hormone that was ever used in any quantity on poultry (DES) was banned in 1959, after everyone but
a few die-hard farmers had given them up as a silly idea. Hormones are now illegal in poultry and
eggs. The people who advertise "No hormones" are either woefully ignorant or are indulging in
cynical fear-mongering, maybe both. [7]

E.coli
======


According to Consumer Reports, "1.1 million or more Americans [are] sickened each year by
undercooked, tainted chicken." A USDA study discovered E.Coli in 99% of supermarket chicken, the
result of chickens being raised in their own feces. Though E. Coli can usually be killed by proper
cooking times, there is still some risk associated with it, and its near-ubiquity in
commercially-farmed chicken is troubling to some.

Avian Flu
=========


There is also a risk that the crowded conditions in many chicken farms will allow avian flu to
spread quickly. A United Nations press release states: "Governments, local authorities and
international agencies need to take a greatly increased role in combating the role of
factory-farming, commerce in live poultry, and wildlife markets which provide ideal conditions for
the virus to spread and mutate into a more dangerous form..."[11]

Efficiency Issues
=================


Farming of chickens on an industrial scale relies on high protein feeds derived from the soybean.
The soybean is also a complete protein source for humans. Giving the feed to chickens means the
nutrients in the feed reach humans with a much lower efficiency than through direct consumption of
soybean products.

Chicken diseases
================

Chickens are susceptible to parasites, including lice, mites, ticks, fleas, and intestinal worms
as well as many other diseases. (Despite the name, they are not affected by Chickenpox; it is a
disease of humans, not chickens.)

Chickens in religion
====================

Chickens, Indonesia



In Indonesia the chicken has great significance during the Hindu cremation ceremony. A chicken is
a channel for evil spirits which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the
leg and kept present at the ceremony for the duration to ensure that any evil spirits present
during the ceremony go into the chicken and not the family members present. The chicken is then
taken home and returns to its normal life. He or she is not treated in any special way or
slaughtered after the ceremony.

In ancient Greece, the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still
considered an exotic animal. Because of its valour, cocks are found as attributes of Ares,
Heracles and Athena. The alleged last words of Socrates as he died from hemlock poisoning, as
recounted by Plato, were "Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?",
signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.

The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of cocks. Several of Aesop's Fables reference this
belief. In the cult of Mithras, the cock was a symbol of the divine light and a guardian against
evil.]

In the Bible, Jesus prophesied the betrayal by Peter: "And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock
shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me." (Luke 22:43)
Thus it happened (Luke 22:61), and Peter cried bitterly. This made the cock a symbol for both
vigilance and betrayal.

Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen, when talking about Jerusalem: "How often would I
have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye
would not!" (Matthew 23:37; also Luke 13:34).

In many Central European folk tales, the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a cock.

In traditional Jewish practice, a chicken is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the
afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called kapparos. The sacrifice of
the chicken is to receive atonement, for the bird takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The
meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a
rooster. Although not actually a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the chicken reminds
the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.

The Talmud speaks of learning "courtesy toward one's mate" from the rooster. This might refer to
the fact that, when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.

The chicken is one of the Zodiac symbols of the Chinese calendar. Also in Chinese religion, a
cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of
village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the Buddha are not one of the recipients of such
offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with "serious" prayer
(while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In Confucian Chinese Weddings, a
chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g sudden
death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close
relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this
practice is rare today.

History
=======

Hen with newly hatched chicks



The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.
The poet Cratinus (mid-5th century BC, according to the later Greek author Athenaeus) calls the
chicken "the Persian alarm". In Aristophanes's comedy The Birds (414 BC) a chicken is called "the
Median bird", which points to an introduction from the East. Pictures of chickens are found on
Greek red figure and black-figure pottery.

In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposia. Delos
seems to have been a centre of chicken breeding.

An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic
chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language (see Austronesian
languages). Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the Lapita
culture, the first Neolithic culture of Oceania.

Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD,
where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian Rat
(Rattus exulans). They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone. Traveling as
cargo on trading boats, they reached the Asian continent via the islands of Indonesia and from
there spread west to Europe and western Asia.

Chickens in ancient Rome
========================


The Romans used chickens for oracles, both when flying ("ex avibus") and when feeding ("auspicium
ex tripudiis"). The hen ("gallina") gave a favourable omen ("auspicium ratum"), when appearing
from the left (Cic.,de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl.

For the oracle "ex tripudiis" according to Cicero (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used,
but normally only chickens ("pulli") were consulted. The chickens were cared for by the pullarius,
who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was
needed. If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises ("occinerent"), beat their wings or flew
away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.

In 249 BC, the Roman general Publius Claudius Pulcher had his chickens thrown overboard when they
refused to feed before the battle of Drepana, saying "If they won't eat, perhaps they will drink."
He promptly lost the battle against the Carthaginians and 93 Roman ships were sunk. Back in Rome,
he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.

In 161 BC a law was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was
renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with
bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet Apicius
offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are
used: the recipes include the stomach, liver, testicles and even the pygostyle (the fatty "tail"
of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).

The Roman author Columella gives advice on chicken breeding in his eighth book of his treatise on
agriculture. He identifies Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as
Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for
cockfighting by the Greeks. For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross
between native hens and Greek cocks. Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but
have no other advantages.

Per Columella, the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if
someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very
fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the
case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only
three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore
their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on
the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give
more male, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings.

Per Columella, Chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is
beneficial for the animals. Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or
ash should be provided for dust-baths.

According to Columella, chicken should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat
bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled
ryegrass (Lollium sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) can be used as
well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle
of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented
with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first
of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility;
this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at
hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.

Columella advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, because they no
longer produce sufficient eggs. Capons were produced by burning out their spurs with a hot iron.
The wound was treated with potter's chalk.

For the use of poultry and eggs in the kitchens of ancient Rome see Roman eating and drinking.

Chickens in South America
=========================

Unless tamed, chickens will naturally nest in trees.



An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the araucana. Araucanas,
some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay
blue-green eggs. As J. Gongora reports, some people have suggested that they predate the arrival
of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-pacific
contacts between Asia and South America. (J. Gongora, et al., "Mitochondrial DNA sequences reveal
a putative East Asian ancestry for old Chilean chickens," Proceedings of the International
Conference on Animal Genetics, ISAG 2006, Porto Seguro, BA, Brasil.)
