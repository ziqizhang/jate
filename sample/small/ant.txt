Ants are eusocial insects that belong to the same order as wasps and bees. They are of particular
interest because of their highly organized colonies or nests which sometimes consist of millions
of individuals. Individuals are divided into infertile females ("workers") and fertile males
("drones") and females ("queens"). Colonies can occupy and use a wide area of land to support
them. Ant colonies are sometimes described as superorganisms because the colony appears to operate
as a single entity.

Ants have colonized almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ant species
are Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland, and the Hawaiian Islands.[1] They may constitute up to 15 to
25% of the total animal biomass.[2] Up to a third (33%) of the terrestrial animal biomass has been
estimated to be made up of ants and termites.[3]

There are about 11,880 known ant species, most of which are tropical.

Termites, sometimes called white ants, though similar in social structure are not closely related
to ants. They comprise the more primitive order Isoptera and are more closely related to
cockroaches. Velvet ants, although resembling large ants, are wingless female wasps.

 Evolution
================


Ants are classified as a family, Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera which also
includes sawflies, bees and wasps. Ants are a lineage derived from within the vespoid wasps.
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ants evolved from vespoids in the mid-Cretaceous period about
120 to 170 million years ago. After the rise of angiosperms about 100 million years ago, ant
evolution also showed rapid change, and by about 60 million years ago ants had moved to ecological
dominance.[4][5] Several fossils from the Cretaceous are intermediate in form between wasps and
ants, further confirming the wasp ancestry of ants. Like other Hymenoptera, the genetic system
found in ants is haplodiploidy.

In 1966 E. O. Wilson, et al. obtained the first amber fossil remains of an ant (Sphecomyrma freyi)
from the Cretaceous era. The specimen was trapped in amber from New Jersey that was more than 80
million years old. This species provides the clearest evidence of a link between modern ants and
non-social wasps. Cretaceous ants shared a couple of wasp-like traits together with modern
ant-like characteristics.[6]

During the Cretaceous era, representatives of only a few species of primitive ants ranged widely
on what was the super-continent Laurasia (the northern hemisphere). They were scarce in comparison
to other insects (about only 1%). It was adaptive radiation which gave ants the dominance at the
beginning of the Tertiary Period. Of the species extant in the Cretaceous and Eocene eras, only 1
of about 10 genera is now extinct. 56% of the genera represented on the Baltic amber fossils
(early Oligocene), and 96% of the genera represented in the Dominican amber fossils (apparently
early Miocene) still survive today.[4]

 Morphology
=================

This closeup shows the prominent mandibles and the comparatively small compound eyes.



Ants are distinguished from other insects by the following traits: elbowed antennae; a strongly
constricted second abdominal segment forming a distinct node-like petiole; and the petiole can be
formed by one or two "parts" or segments (only the second, or the second and third abdominal
segments can form it). Ants have a wingless worker caste; the presence of a metapleural gland is
also distinctive.

Ant bodies, like other insects, have an exoskeleton, meaning their bodies are externally covered
in a protective casing, as opposed to the internal skeletal framework of humans and other
vertebrates. Ants do not have lungs. Oxygen passes through tiny pores, the spiracles, in their
exoskeleton - the same holes through which carbon dioxide leaves their body. Nor do they have a
heart; a colorless blood, the hemolymph, runs from their head to rear and back again along a long
tube. Their nervous system is much like a human spinal cord in that it is a continuous cord, the
ventral nerve cord, from head to rear with branches into each extremity.

The three main divisions of the ant body are the head, mesosoma and metasoma.

The head of an ant has many important parts. Ant eyes are compound eyes, similar to fly eyes: they
have many smaller eyes attached together which enables them to see movement very well. Most ants
have poor to mediocre eyesight; some are blind altogether. A few have exceptional vision though,
such as Australia's bulldog ant. Also attached to the head of an ant are two feelers. The feelers
are special smelling organs that help ants communicate. Ants release pheromones (chemicals that
have different smells) to communicate with each other and the feelers pick up these smells as
signals. The head also has two strong pinchers, the mandibles, which are used to carry food,
manipulate objects, construct nests, and to defend. There is also a small pocket inside the mouth
where ants can store food and give to others.

The thorax of the ant is where all six legs are attached. At the end of each leg is a sharp claw
that helps ants climb and hang onto things. Most queens and male ants have wings, which they drop
after the nuptial flight; however wingless queens (ergatoids) and males can occur.

The metasoma of the ant houses many of the important internal organs. Some species of ants have
stingers used for subduing prey and defending their nests.

 Development
==================

Polymorphic castes

The life of an ant starts with an egg. If the egg is fertilized, the ant will be female (diploid);
if not, it will be male (haploid). Ants are holometabolous, and develop by complete metamorphosis,
passing through larval and pupal stages (with the pupae being exarate) before they become adults.
The larval stage is particularly helpless â€“ for instance it lacks legs entirely â€“ and cannot
care for itself. The difference between queens and workers (which are both female), and between
different castes of workers when they exist, is determined by the feeding in the larval stage.
Food is given to the larvae by a process called trophallaxis in which an ant regurgitates food
previously held in its crop for communal storage. This is also how adults distribute food amongst
themselves. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper
development, and so are often moved around various brood chambers within the colony.

A new worker spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. After
that it graduates to digging and other nest work, and then to foraging and defense of the nest.
These changes are fairly abrupt and define what are called temporal castes. One theory of why this
occurs is because foraging has a high death rate, so ants only participate in it when they are
older and closer to death anyway. In a few ants there are also physical castes â€“ workers come in
a spectrum of sizes, called minor, median, and major workers, the latter beginning foraging
sooner. Often the larger ants will have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly
stronger mandibles. Such individuals are sometimes called "soldier" ants because their stronger
mandibles make them more effective in fighting other creatures, although they are still in fact
worker ants and their "duties" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In
a few species the median workers have disappeared, creating a sharp divide and clear physical
difference between the minors and majors.

Most of the common ant species breed in the same way. Only the queen and breeding females have the
ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens. The male ants,
called drones, along with the breeding females emerge from pupation with wings (although some
species, like army ants, don't produce winged queens), and do nothing throughout their life except
eat, until the time for mating comes. At this time, all breeding ants, excluding the queen, are
carried outside where other colonies of similar species are doing the same. Then, all the winged
breeding ants take flight. Mating occurs in flight and the males die shortly afterward. The
females that survive land and seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their
own wings and begin to lay eggs, which they care for. Sperm obtained during their nuptial flight
is stored and used to fertilize all future eggs produced. The first workers to hatch are weak and
smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest,
forage for food and care for the other eggs. This is how most new colonies start. A few species
that have multiple queens can start a new colony as a queen from the old nest takes a number of
workers to a new site and founds a colony there.

Ant colonies can be long-lived. The queens themselves can live for up to 30 years, while workers
live from 1 to 3 years. Males, however, are short lived and live for only a few weeks.[7]

 Polymorphism
===================

Myrmecocystus (Honeypot) ants store food to prevent colony famine.



Ants show a wide range of morphological differences between the castes. While in some species,
these differences are small, they are large in others. In some ant species there can be several
size variants within the worker castes.[8] The gonads in the workers are not functional, and
sometimes they are even strongly reduced.

Some ants, called honeypot ants, have special workers called repletes who simply store food for
the rest of the colony, generally becoming immobile with greatly enlarged abdomens. In hot, dry
places, even deserts, in Africa, North America, and Australia where they live, they are considered
by some people to be a great delicacy.

 Behavior and ecology
===========================

 Communication
====================

Ant communication is accomplished primarily through chemicals called pheromones. Because most ants
spend their time in direct contact with the ground, these chemical messages are more developed
than in other hymenopterans. So for instance, when a forager finds food, she will leave a
pheromone trail along the ground on her way home. In a short time other ants will follow this
pheromone trail. Home is often located through the use of remembered landmarks and the position of
the sun as detected with compound eyes and also by means of special sky polarization-detecting
fibers within the eyes.[9][10]Returning home, they reinforce this same trail which in turn
attracts more ants until the food is exhausted, after which the trail is no longer reinforced and
so slowly dissipates. This behavior helps ants adapt to changes in their environment. When an
established path to a food source is blocked by a new obstacle, the foragers leave the path to
explore new routes. If successful, the returning ant leaves a new trail marking the shortest
route. Since each ant prefers to follow a path richer in pheromone rather than poorer, the
resulting route is also the shortest available.

Ants make use of pheromones for other purposes as well. A crushed ant, for example, will emit an
alarm pheromone which in high concentration sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy; and in lower
concentration, merely attracts them. To confuse their enemies several ant species even employ
"propaganda pheromones", which cause their enemies to fight among themselves.[11]

Like other insects, ants smell with their antennae, which are long and thin. These are fairly
mobile, having a distinct elbow joint after an elongated first segment; and since they come in
pairs--rather like binocular vision or stereophonic sound equipment--they provide information
about direction as well as intensity. Pheromones are also exchanged as compounds mixed with food
and passed in trophallaxis, giving the ants information about one another's health and nutrition.
Ants can also detect what task group (e.g. foraging or nest maintenance) to which other ants
belong. Of special note, the queen produces a certain pheromone without which the workers would
begin raising new queens.

Some ants also produce sounds by stridulation using the gaster segments and also using their
mandibles. They may serve to communicate among colony members as well as in interactions with
other species.[12][13][14]

 Defense
==============

Ants attack and defend themselves by biting and in many species, stinging, often injecting
chemicals like formic acid. Bullet ants (the genus Paraponera), located in Central and South
America, are considered to have the most painful sting among insects, although these are usually
non-fatal. They are given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index. Jack jumper ants,
Myrmecia pilosula, located in Australia have stings that cause fatality to a small number of
people in the population, and cause hospitalizations each year.

Fire ants, Solenopsis spp., are unique in having a poison sac containing piperidine alkaloids.[15]

Some ants of the genus Odontomachus are equipped with mandibles called trap-jaws. This snap-jaw
mechanism, or catapult mechanism, is possible because energy is stored in the large closing
muscles. The blow is incredibly fast, about 0.5?ms in the genus Mystrium. Before the strike, the
mandibles open wide and are locked in the open position by the labrum, which functions as a latch.
The attack is triggered by stimulation of sensory hairs at the side of the mandibles. The
mandibles are also able to function as a tool for more finely adjusted tasks. Two similar groups
are Odontomachus and Dacetini - examples of convergent evolution.

 Learning
===============


While many types of animals can learn behaviors by imitating other animals, ants may be the only
group of animals besides primates and some other mammals in which interactive teaching behavior
has been observed. Knowledgeable forager ants of the species Temnothorax albipennis directly lead
naÃ¯ve nest-mates to newly discovered food sources by the excruciatingly slow (and time-costly)
process of tandem running. The follower thereby obtains knowledge that it would not have, had it
not been tutored, and this is at the expense of its nest-mate teacher. Both leader and follower
are acutely sensitive to the progress of their partner. For example, the leader slows down when
the follower lags too far behind, and speeds up when the follower gets too close, while the
follower does the opposite.[16]

 Nest construction
========================


While some ants form complex nests and galleries, other species are nomadic and do not build
permanent structures. Some species form subterranean nests, while others build nests on trees. The
materials used for construction include soil and plant matter.

Some of the more advanced ants are the army ants and driver ants, from South America and Africa
respectively. Unlike most species which have permanent nests, army and driver ants do not form
permanent nests, but instead alternate between nomadic stages and stages where the workers form a
temporary nest (bivouac) out of their own bodies. Colonies reproduce either through nuptial
flights as described above, or by fission, where a group of workers simply dig a new hole and
raise new queens. Colony members are distinguished by smell, and other intruders are usually
attacked.

Weaver ants (Oecophylla) build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them
together with bridges of workers and then sewing them together by pressing silk-producing larvae
against them in alternation.

 Food cultivation
=======================



        Main article: Ant-fungus mutualism

Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a special fungus that lives only within
their colonies. They continually collect leaves which they cut into tiny pieces for the fungus to
grow on. These ants have several differently sized castes especially for cutting up the pieces
they are supplied with into even smaller pieces. Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to
the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the
fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus the colony will no longer collect it.
The ants grow the fungus because it produces special structures called gongylidia which are fed on
by the ants. They create antibiotics on their exterior surfaces with the aid of symbiotic
bacteria, and subsist entirely on this farming of the fungus.

 Navigation
=================


Desert ants Cataglyphis fortis make use of visual landmarks in combination with other cues to
navigate.[17]

In the absence of visual landmarks, Sahara desert ants have been shown to navigate by keeping
track of direction as well as distance travelled, like an internal pedometer that keeps tracks of
how many steps they take, and use this information to find the shortest routes back to their
nests.[18]

 Locomotion
=================


Ants usually lose, or never develop, their wings. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most
ants travel by walking.

The more cooperative species of ants sometimes form chains to bridge gaps, whether that be over
water, underground, or through spaces in arboreal paths.

Harpegnathos saltator



Among their reproductive members, most species of ant do not retain wings beyond their mating
flight; most females remove their own wings when returning to the ground to lay eggs, while the
males almost invariably die after that maiden flight.

Some ants are even capable of leaping. A particularly notable species is Jerdon's jumping ant,
Harpegnathos saltator. This is achieved by synchronized action of the mid and hind pair of
legs.[19]

Polyrhachis sokolova, a species of ant found in Australian mangrove swamps, can swim and lives in
nests that are submerged underwater. They make use of trapped pockets of air in the submerged
nests.[20]

There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus. In fact this may be a
common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to direct the direction of
their descent while falling.[21]

 Ant cooperation and competition
======================================

Meat eater ants feeding on honey - social ants cooperate and collectively gather food.



Not all ants have the same kind of societies. The Australian bulldog ants are among the biggest
and most primitive of ants. The individual hunts alone, using its large eyes instead of its
chemical senses to find prey. Like all ants they are social, but their social behavior is poorly
developed compared to more advanced species. The Australian bulldog ant, Myrmecia pilosula, has
only a single pair of chromosomes and males have just one chromosome as they are haploid.

Some species of ants are known for attacking and taking over the colonies of other ant species.
Others are less expansionist but nonetheless just as aggressive; they attack colonies to steal
eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers/slaves. Some ants, such as the Amazon
ants, are incapable of feeding themselves, but must rely on captured worker ants to care for them.
In some cases ant colonies may have other species of ants or termites within the same nest.[22]

The pavement ant is famous for its urge to increase its territory. In early spring, colonies
attempt to conquer new areas and often attack the nearest enemy colony. These result in huge
sidewalk battles, sometimes leaving thousands of ants dead. Because of their aggressive nature,
they often invade and colonize seemingly impenetrable areas.

Ants identify kin and nestmates through their scents, a hydrocarbon-laced secretion that coats
their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the
colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony with a different scent than that of the colony will be
attacked.[23] (See also Kin selection)

 Diversity
================

There is a great diversity among ants and their behaviors. They range in size from 2 to about
25?mm (about 0.08 to 1?inch). Their color may vary; most are red or black, but other colors can
also be seen, including some tropical groups with a metallic luster. (See also ant genera).
Numerous species of ant continue to be added in present times and taxonomic studies continue to
resolve the classification and systematics of ants. Online databases of ant species include
AntBase and the Hymenoptera Name Server.[24]

Ants have been used as indicator species in biodiversity studies.[25][26]

 Relationships with other species
=======================================


Ants are associated with other species in a wide variety of ways. These associations include
mutualistic and parasitic relationships as well as interactions with more than one species which
are not fully understood. Well known relationships are between other insects, especially those
that secrete honeydew and those with plants and fungi.

Aphids secrete a sweet liquid called honeydew. The sugars provide a high-energy food source, which
many ant species use. Normally this is allowed to fall to the ground, but around ants it is kept
for them to collect. The ants in turn keep predators away and will move the aphids around to
better feeding locations. Upon migrating to a new area, many colonies will take new aphids with
them, to ensure that they have a supply of honeydew in the new area. Ants also tend mealybugs to
harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs can become a serious pest of pineapple if ants are present to
protect mealybugs from natural enemies.[27][28]

Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) caterpillars of the family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or
hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the
ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage
them. Some caterpillars are known to produce vibrations and sounds that are sensed by the
ants.[29] Some caterpillars have evolved from being ant-loving to ant-eating and these
myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone which makes the ants think that the caterpillar's
larva is one of their own. The larva will then be taken into the ants' nest where it can feed on
the ant larvae.

Fungus-growing ants that make up the tribe attini, including leafcutter ants, actively cultivate
certain species of fungus in the Leucoagaricus or Leucocoprinus genera of the Agaricaceae family.
In this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend on each other for survival. Allomerus
decemarticulatus has evolved a tripartite association with their host plant Hirtella physophora
(Chrysobalanaceae), and a fungus in order to ambush and obtain protein nutrition from prey
insects.[30]

Lemon ants make Devil's gardens by killing all surrounding plants besides lemon ant trees. Many
trees have extrafloral nectaries that provide food for ants and the ants in turn protect the plant
from herbivorous insects. Some species like the bullhorn acacia, Acacia cornigera, in Central
America have hollow thorns that serve to house colonies of stinging ants, Pseudomyrmex ferruginea,
that defend the tree against insects, browsing mammals, and epiphytic vines. In return, the ants
obtain food from protein-lipid Beltian bodies. Another example of this type of ectosymbiosis comes
from the Macaranga tree which have stems adapted to house colonies of Crematogaster ants. Many
tropical tree species have seeds that are dispersed by ants.[31]

Calliphoridae in the Old World genus Bengalia are kleptoparasites and predators on ants and often
snatch prey or brood from the adult ants.[32] A Malaysian phorid fly Vestigipoda myrmolarvoidea
has females that are wingless and legless and they live in the nests of ants of the genus
Aenictus, being fed and cared for by the ants.[32]

Many species of birds show a peculiar behaviour called anting that is as yet not fully understood.
Here birds may rest on ant nests or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers, presumably
to rid themselves of ectoparasites.

A fungus, Cordyceps, has been known to infect ants, causing them to climb up plants and sinking
their mandibles into the plant tissue. The fungus kills and engulfs the ant and produces its
fruiting body. A theory is that the fungus alters the behaviour of the ant and benefits by helping
in dispersal of the spores that emerge from the ant as it is engulfed by the growing fungus.[33]

Some South American frogs in the genus Dendrobates feed primarily on ants and the toxins on their
skin may be derived from the ants.[34]

Brown bears (Ursus arctos) have been found to feed on ants, with as much as 12, 16, and 4% of
their fecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively being made up of ants.[35]

Many species of mammals such as anteaters, pangolins and several marsupial species in Australia
have special adaptations for living on a primary diet of ants. These adaptations include long
sticky tongues to pick the ants and strong claws to break into the ant nests. Some South American
birds such as the antpittas are also ant predators.

 Humans and ants
======================

Ants are useful for clearing out insect pests and aerating the soil. On the other hand, they can
become annoyances when they invade homes, yards, gardens and fields. Carpenter ants damage wood by
hollowing it out for nesting.

In some parts of the world large ants, especially army ants, are said to be used as sutures by
pressing the wound together and applying ants along it. The ant in defensive attitude seizes the
edges in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles can
remain in place, closing the wound.[36]

Some species, called killer ants, have a tendency to attack much larger animals during foraging or
in defending their nests. Attacks on humans are rare, but the stings and bites can be quite
painful and in large enough numbers can be disabling.

The Masai of Africa had an abiding respect for the Siafu ants, voracious predators that consume a
large amount of insects and are welcomed for the benefit they bring to farmers, as they will
eliminate all pests from a crop and quickly move on.

 Ant eating
=================



        Main article: Entomophagy

Ants and their larvae are eaten in different parts of the world. In the Colombian department of
Santander Hormigas Culonas (lit.?: "fatass ants") Atta laevigata are toasted alive and eaten.[37]
This tradition has come down from the native Guanes. In parts of Thailand, ants are prepared and
eaten in various ways. Khorat ant eggs and diced flying ants are eaten as an appetizer. Weaver ant
eggs and larvae as well as the ants themselves may be used in a Thai salad, yum (à¸¢à¸³), in a
dish called yum khai mod daeng (à¸¢à¸³à¹„à¸‚à¹ˆà¸¡à¸”à¹?à¸”à¸‡) or red ant egg salad, a dish that
comes from the Issan or north-eastern region of Thailand. In South Africa, ants are used to help
in rooibos, Aspalathus linearis, cultivation: They collect the plant's seeds which can then be
easily harvested by planters.

Charles Thomas Bingham notes that in parts of India, and throughout Burma and Siam, a paste of the
green weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, is served as a condiment with curry. Saville Kent, in the
Naturalist in Australia wrote "Beauty, in the case of the green ant, is more than skin-deep. Their
attractive, almost sweetmeat-like translucency possibly invited the first essays at their
consumption by the human species." Mashed up in water, after the manner of lemon squash, "these
ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of North Queensland,
and is even appreciated by many European palates."[38]

John Muir, in his First Summer in the Sierra notes that the Digger Indians of California ate the
tickly acid gasters of the large jet-black carpenter ants. The Mexican Indians eat the replete
workers, or living honey-pots, of the honey ant (Myrmecocystus).[38]

 Ants as pests
====================


Modern society considers the ant a pest, and due to the adaptive nature of ant colonies,
eliminating one is near impossible. Pest control with regard to ants is more a matter of
controlling local populations than eliminating an entire colony. Attempts to control ant
populations of any kind are temporary solutions.

Typical ants that are classified as pests include pavement ants (otherwise known as the sugar
ant), Pharaoh ants, carpenter ants, Argentine ants, and the red imported fire ant. Control of
species populations are usually done with bait insecticides, which are either in the form of small
granules, or as a sticky liquid that is gathered by the ants as food and then brought back to the
nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other members of the brood â€” a system that can
severely reduce the numbers in a colony if used properly. Boric acid and borax are often used as
insecticides that are relatively safe for humans. With the recent insurgence of the red imported
fire ant, a tactic called broadcast baiting has been employed, by which the substance (usually a
granule bait designed specifically for fire ants) is spread across a large area, such as a lawn,
in order to control populations. Nests may be destroyed by tracing the ants' trails back to the
nest, then pouring boiling water into it to kill the queen. (Killing individual ants is less than
effective due to the secretion of pheromones mentioned above).

Ants that tend other insects can indirectly cause pest infestations. Many homopteran insects that
are considered as horticultural pests are controlled by the use of grease rings on the trunks of
the trees. These rings cut off the routes for ants and make the pest species vulnerable to
parasites and predators.

 Ants in culture
======================


Ants have often been used in fables and children's stories to represent industriousness and
cooperative effort, as well as aggressiveness and vindictiveness. They are also mentioned in
religious texts.[39][40] In parts of Africa, ants are the messengers of the gods. Ant bites are
often said to have curative properties. Some Native American religions, such as Hopi mythology,
recognize ants as the very first animals. Others use ant bites in initiation ceremonies as a test
of endurance.

The Japanese word for ant, ari, is represented by an ideograph formed of the character for insect
combined with the character signifying moral rectitude, propriety (giri). So the Chinese character
could possibly be read as The Propriety-Insect. Its actual etymology is likely to be different
however.[41]

Ant society has always fascinated humans and has been written about both humorously and seriously
by writers. Mark Twain wrote about ants in his A Tramp Abroad. In more recent times, animated
cartoons featuring ants have been produced include Antz, A Bug's Life, The Ant Bully, The Ant and
the Aardvark and Atom Ant.

 Ant inspired technology
==============================


The successful techniques used by ant colonies has been widely studied especially in computer
science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems. This
area of biomimetics has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines which make use of
foraging trails and fault tolerant storage and networking algorithms.[42] (See also Langton's ant,
Ant colony optimization)
