Shark (superorder Selachimorpha) are fish with a full cartilaginous skeleton[1] and a streamlined
body. They respire with the use of five to seven gill slits. Sharks have a covering of dermal
denticles to protect their skin from damage and parasites and to improve fluid dynamics.[1] They
have replaceable teeth. They are some of the world's most misunderstood predators, as they very
rarely attack humans unless intimidated. In fact, humans kill around 26 to 73 million sharks every
year, compared to 5 human deaths every year. Much of this comes from killing them for their fins,
which usually consists of the catcher cutting off the fins while the sharks are still alive, then
throwing them back in, where they usually die.

Sharks include species from the hand-sized pygmy shark, Euprotomicrus bispinatus, a deep sea
species of only 22?centimetres (9 inches) in length, to the whale shark, Rhincodon typus, the
largest fish, which grows to a length of approximately 12?metres (41?feet) and which, like the
great whales, feeds only on plankton through filter feeding. The bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas,
is the best known of several species to swim in both salt and fresh water (it is found in Lake
Nicaragua, in Central America) and in deltas.[2]

 Physical characteristics
===============================



        Main article: Physical characteristics of sharks

 Skeleton
===============


The skeleton of a shark is very different from that of bony fishes such as cod; it is made from
cartilage, which is very light and flexible, although the cartilage in older sharks can sometimes
be partly calcified, making it harder and more bone-like. The shark's jaw is variable and is
thought to have evolved from the first gill arch. It is not attached to the cranium and has extra
mineral deposits to give it greater strength.[3]

 Respiration
==================

Like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. Some sharks
have a modified slit called a spiracle located just behind the eye, which is used in
respiration.[4] While moving, water passes through the mouth of the shark and over the gills --
this process is known as "ram ventilation". While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills
to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. A small subset of shark species that spend their
life constantly swimming, a behavior common in pelagic sharks, have lost the ability to pump water
through their gills. These species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if
unable to stay in motion. (Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic fish species.)[5]

The respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the shark's
two-chambered heart. Here the blood is pumped to the shark's gills via the ventral aorta artery
where it branches off into afferent brachial arteries. Reoxygenation takes place in the gills and
the reoxygenated blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries, which come together to form the
dorsal aorta. The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. The deoxygenated blood
from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal
sinuses. From there blood enters the ventricle of the heart and the cycle repeats.

 Buoyancy
===============


Unlike bony fishes, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders, but instead rely on a large liver
filled with oil that contains squalene. The liver may constitute up to 25% of their body mass[6]
for buoyancy. Its effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth and
sink when they stop swimming. Some sharks, if inverted, enter a natural state of tonic immobility
- researchers use this condition for handling sharks safely.[7]

 Osmoregulation
=====================


In contrast to bony fishes, sharks do not drink seawater; instead they retain high concentrations
of waste chemicals in their body to change the diffusion gradient so that they can absorb water
directly from the sea. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in fresh water, and
they are therefore confined to a marine environment. A few exceptions to this rule exist, such as
the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts
of urea.[6]

 Teeth
============

Tiger shark teeth



The teeth of carnivorous sharks are not attached to the jaw, but embedded in the flesh, and in
many species are constantly replaced throughout the shark's life; some sharks can lose 30,000
teeth in a lifetime. All sharks have multiple rows of teeth along the edges of their upper and
lower jaws. New teeth grow continuously in a groove just inside the mouth and move forward from
inside the mouth on a "conveyor belt" formed by the skin in which they are anchored. In some
sharks rows of teeth are replaced every 8–10 days, while in other species they could last
several months. The lower teeth are primarily used for holding prey, while the upper ones are used
for cutting into it.[4] The teeth range from thin, needle-like teeth for gripping fish to large,
flat teeth adapted for crushing shellfish.

 Tails
============

The tails (caudal fins) of sharks vary considerably between species and are adapted to the
lifestyle of the shark. The tail provides thrust and so speed and acceleration are dependent on
tail shape. Different tail shapes have evolved in sharks adapted for different environments. The
tiger shark's tail has a large upper lobe which delivers the maximum amount of power for slow
cruising or sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark has a varied diet, and because of this it must
be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting, whereas the porbeagle, which hunts
schooling fishes such as mackerel and herring has a large lower lobe to provide greater speed to
help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. It is also believed that sharks use the upper lobe
of their tails to counter the lift generated by their pectoral fins. [8]

Some tail adaptations have purposes other than providing thrust. The cookiecutter shark has a tail
with broad lower and upper lobes of similar shape which are luminescent and may help to lure prey
towards the shark. The thresher feeds on fish and squid, which it is believed to herd, then stun
with its powerful and elongated upper lobe.

 Dermal denticles
=======================



        Main article: Dermal denticle

Unlike bony fishes, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibres and
arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This works as an outer skeleton, providing
attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. Their dermal teeth give them
hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.]

 Body temperature
=======================


A few of the larger species, such as the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, and the great white,
are mildly homeothermic[8] - able to maintain their body temperature above the surrounding water
temperature. This is possible because of the presence of the rete mirabile, a counter current
exchange mechanism that reduces the loss of body heat. Muscular contraction also generates a mild
amount of body heat. However, this differs significantly from true homeothermy, as found in
mammals and birds, in which heat is generated, maintained, and regulated by metabolic activity.

 Etymology
================


Until the 16th century,[9] sharks were known to mariners as "sea dogs".[10] According to the OED
the name "shark" first came into use after Sir John Hawkins' sailors exhibited one in London in
1569 to refer to the large sharks of the Caribbean Sea, and later as a general term for all
sharks. The name may have been derived from the Mayan word for fish, xoc, pronounced "shock" or
"shawk".

 Evolution
================

A collection of fossilised shark teeth



The fossil record of sharks extends back over 450 million years - before land vertebrates existed
and before many plants had colonised the continents.[11] The first sharks looked very different
from modern sharks.[12] The majority of the modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million
years ago.[13]

Mostly only the fossilized teeth of sharks are found, although often in large numbers. In some
cases pieces of the internal skeleton or even complete fossilized sharks have been discovered.
Estimates suggest that over a span of a few years a shark may grow tens of thousands of teeth,
which explains the abundance of fossils. As the teeth consist of mineral apatite (calcium
phosphate), they are easily fossilized.

Instead of bones, sharks have cartilagenous skeletons, with a bone-like layer broken up into
thousands of isolated apatite prisms. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up and
the apatite prisms scatter. Complete shark skeletons are only preserved when rapid burial in
bottom sediments occurs.

Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago,[12]
which has been found within the Paleozoic strata of Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. At this point in
the Earth's history these rocks made up the soft sediment of the bottom of a large, shallow ocean,
which stretched across much of North America. Cladoselache was only about 1?m long with stiff
triangular fins and slender jaws.[12] Its teeth had several pointed cusps, which would have been
worn down by use. From the number of teeth found in any one place it is most likely that
Cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. Its caudal fins had a
similar shape to the pelagic makos and great white sharks. The discovery of whole fish found tail
first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.

From about 300 to 150 million years ago, most fossil sharks can be assigned to one of two groups.
One of these, the xenacanths, was almost exclusive to freshwater environments.[14],[15] By the
time this group became extinct (about 220 million years ago) they had achieved worldwide
distribution. The other group, the hybodonts, appeared about 320 million years ago and was mostly
found in the oceans, but also in freshwater.

Modern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago.[13] Fossil mackerel shark teeth
occurred in the Lower Cretaceous. The oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 65 million years
ago, around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs. In early white shark evolution there are
at least two lineages: one with coarsely serrated teeth that probably gave rise to the modern
great white shark, and another with finely serrated teeth and a tendency to attain gigantic
proportions. This group includes the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon, which like most
extinct sharks is only known from its teeth. A reproduction of its jaws was based on some of the
largest teeth which up to almost 17?cm (7?in) long and suggested a fish that could grow to a
length of 25 to 30.5?m (80 to 100?ft). The reconstruction was found to be inaccurate, and
estimates revised downwards to around 13 to 15.9?m (43 to 52?ft).

It is believed that the immense size of predatory sharks such as the great white may have arisen
from the extinction of the dinosaurs and the diversification of mammals. It is known that at the
same time these sharks were evolving some early mammalian groups evolved into aquatic forms.
Certainly, wherever the teeth of large sharks have been found, there has also been an abundance of
marine mammal bones, including seals, porpoises and whales. These bones frequently show signs of
shark attack. There are theories that suggest that large sharks evolved to better take advantage
of larger prey.

 Classification
=====================

Sharks belong to the superorder Selachimorpha in the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class
Chondrichthyes. The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the Chondrichthyes also include
Chimaeras. It is currently thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group: in particular, some
sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks.

There are more than 360 described species of sharks.

There are eight orders of sharks, listed below in roughly their evolutionary relationship from
more primitive to more modern species:

* Hexanchiformes: Examples from this group include the cow sharks, frilled shark and even a
  shark that looks on first inspection to be a marine snake.
* Squaliformes: This group includes the bramble sharks, dogfish and roughsharks, and prickly
  shark.
* Pristiophoriformes: These are the sawsharks, with an elongated, toothed snout that they use
  for slashing the fish that they eat.
* Squatiniformes: Also known as angel sharks, they are flattened sharks with a strong
  resemblance to stingrays and skates.
* Heterodontiformes: They are generally referred to as the bullhead or horn sharks.
* Orectolobiformes: They are commonly referred to as the carpet sharks, including zebra sharks,
  nurse sharks, wobbegongs and the whale shark.
* Carcharhiniformes: These are commonly referred to as the groundsharks, and some of the species
  include the blue, tiger, bull, reef and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the requiem
  sharks) along with the houndsharks, catsharks and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by
  an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.
* Lamniformes: They are commonly known as the mackerel sharks. They include the goblin shark,
  basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great
  white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The
  Lamniformes include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.

 Reproduction
===================

Claspers of male spotted wobbegong, Orectolobus maculatus



The sex of a shark can be easily determined. The males have modified pelvic fins which have become
a pair of claspers. The name is somewhat misleading as they are not used to hold on to the female,
but fulfil the role of the mammalian penis.

Mating has rarely been observed in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling
around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the
male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite
marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The
bite marks may also come from courtship behaviour: the male may bite the female to show his
interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.

Sharks have a different reproductive strategy from most fish. Instead of producing huge numbers of
eggs and fry (99.9% of which never reach sexual maturity in fishes which use this strategy),
sharks normally produce around a dozen pups (blue sharks have been recorded as producing 135 and
some species produce as few as two).[16] These pups are either protected by egg cases or born
live. No shark species are known to provide post-natal parental protection for their young, but
females have a hormone that is released into their blood during the pupping season that apparently
keeps them from feeding on their young].

Egg case of Port Jackson shark - found on Vincentia beach, Jervis Bay Territory, Australia



There are three ways in which shark pups are born:

* Oviparity - Some sharks lay eggs. In most of these species, the developing embryo is protected
  by an egg case with the consistency of leather. Sometimes these cases are corkscrewed into
  crevices for protection. The mermaid's purse, found washed-up on beaches, is an empty egg case.
  Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.[17]
* Viviparity - These sharks maintain a placental link to the developing young, more analogous to
  mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional.
  Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and tiger sharks), the basking shark and the
  smooth dogfish fall into this category. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any
  shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking sharks and frilled sharks are likely to have even longer
  gestation periods, but accurate data is lacking.[16]
* Ovoviviparity - Most sharks utilize this method. The young are nourished by the yolk of their
  egg and by fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct. The eggs hatch within the
  oviduct, and the young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's
  fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Some species practice
  oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs in the oviduct. This practice
  is believed to be present in all lamniforme sharks, while the developing pups of the grey nurse
  shark take this a stage further and consume other developing embryos (intrauterine cannibalism).
  The survival strategy for the species that are ovoviviparous is that the young are able to grow
  to a comparatively larger size before being born. The whale shark is now considered to be in
  this category after long having been classified as oviparous. Whale shark eggs found are now
  thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including
  bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas because of the protection from
  predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food.

 Shark senses
===================

 Sense of smell
=====================


Sharks have keen olfactory senses, with some species able to detect as little as one part per
million of blood and in seawater. They are attracted to the chemicals found in the guts of many
species, and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls. Some species, such as nurse
sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey. The short duct
between the anterior and posterior nasal openings are not fused as in bony fishes.

Sharks generally rely on their superior sense of smell to find prey, but at closer range they also
use the lateral lines running along their sides to sense movement in the water, and also employ
special sensory pores on their heads (Ampullae of Lorenzini) to detect electrical fields created
by prey and the ambient electric fields of the ocean.

 Sense of sight
=====================


Shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, including similar lenses, corneas and
retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment with the help of a tissue
called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to the retina,
thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with
some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink
because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some have nictitating
membranes. This membrane covers the eyes during predation, and when the shark is being attacked.
However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this
membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey.

 Sense of hearing
=======================


Sharks also have a sharp sense of hearing and can hear prey many miles away. A small opening on
each side of their heads (not to be confused with the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear
through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, as it is open to the
environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common
origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the
acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fishes and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear
has been lost.

 Ampullae of Lorenzini
============================



        Main article: Ampullae of Lorenzini

Electroreceptors (Ampullae of Lorenzini) and lateral line canals in the head of a shark.



The Ampullae of Lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs of the shark, and they vary in number
from a couple of hundred to thousands in an individual. The shark has the greatest electricity
sensitivity known in all animals. This sense is used to find prey hidden in sand by detecting the
electric fields inadvertently produced by all fish. It is this sense that sometimes confuses a
shark into attacking a boat: when the metal interacts with salt water, the electrochemical
potentials generated by the rusting metal are similar to the weak fields of prey, or in some
cases, much stronger than the prey's electrical fields: strong enough to attract sharks from miles
away. The oceanic currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields
that can be used by the sharks for orientation and navigation.

 Lateral line
===================



        Main article: Lateral line

This system is found in most fish, including sharks. It is used to detect motion or vibrations in
the water. The shark uses this to detect the movements of other organisms, especially wounded
fish. The shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50?Hz.[18]

 Behaviour
================


Studies on the behaviour of sharks have only recently been carried out leading to little
information on the subject, although this is changing. The classic view of the shark is that of a
solitary hunter, ranging the oceans in search of food; however, this is only true for a few
species, with most living far more sedentary, benthic lives. Even solitary sharks meet for
breeding or on rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a
year.[19] Migration patterns in sharks may be even more complex than in birds, with many sharks
covering entire ocean basins.

Some sharks can be highly social, remaining in large schools, sometimes up to over 100 individuals
for scalloped hammerheads congregating around seamounts and islands e.g. in the Gulf of
California.[6] Cross-species social hierarchies exist with oceanic whitetip sharks dominating
silky sharks of comparable size when feeding.

When approached too closely some sharks will perform a threat display to warn off the prospective
predators. This usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements, and can vary in intensity
according to the level of threat.[20]

 Shark intelligence
=========================


Despite the common myth that sharks are instinct-driven "eating machines", recent studies have
indicated that many species possess powerful problem-solving skills, social complexity and
curiosity.The brain-mass-to-body-mass ratios of sharks are similar to those of mammals and other
higher vertebrate species.[21]

In 1987, near Smitswinkle Bay, South Africa, a group of up to seven great white sharks worked
together to relocate the partially beached body of a dead whale to deeper waters to feed.[22]

Sharks have even been known to engage in playful activities (a trait also observed in cetaceans
and primates). Porbeagle sharks have been seen repeatedly rolling in kelp and have even been
observed chasing an individual trailing a piece behind them.[23]

 Shark sleep
==================


It is unclear how sharks sleep. Some sharks can lie on the bottom while actively pumping water
over their gills, but their eyes remain open and actively follow divers. When a shark is resting,
they do not use their nares, but rather their spiracles. If a shark tried to use their nares while
resting on the ocean floor, they would be sucking up sand rather than water. Many scientists
believe this is one of the reasons sharks have spiracles. The spiny dogfish's spinal cord, rather
than its brain, coordinates swimming, so it is possible for a spiny dogfish to continue to swim
while sleeping. It is also possible that a shark can sleep with only parts of its brain in a
manner similar to dolphins.[24]

 Shark attacks
====================



        Main article: Shark attack

bite a human, mistaking it for prey. Under normal conditions they are harmless and shy.



Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 360
species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on
humans: the great white, tiger, oceanic whitetip and bull sharks.[25] These sharks, being large,
powerful predators, may sometimes attack and kill people, but all of these sharks have been filmed
in open water, without the use of a protective cage.[26]

The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularised by publicity given to a few
isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore Shark Attacks of 1916, and through popular
fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. The author of Jaws, Peter
Benchley, had in his later years attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.
In 2005, according to the International Shark Attack File, there were a total of 58 unprovoked
attacks recorded worldwide, of which four were fatal.[27]

In 2005 the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) took an investigation on 105 shark attacks. Out
of those 105, 58 of the attacks were unprovoked. [28]

 Habitat
==============


A December 10, 2006 report by the Census of Marine Life group reveals that 70% of the world's
oceans are shark-free. They have discovered that although many sharks live up to depths as low as
1,500 m (5,000 ft), they fail to colonize deeper, putting them more easily within reach of
fisheries and thus endangered status.[29]

 Sharks in captivity
==========================

Two whale sharks in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium



Until recently only a few benthic species of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and
catsharks could survive in aquaria conditions for up to a year or more. This gave rise to the
belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care
for. A better knowledge of sharks has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks)
being able to be kept for far longer. At the same time, transportation techniques have improved
and now provide a way for the long distance movement of sharks.[30]

Despite controlled feeding behaviour being considered critical for the health of the shark, very
few studies on this topic have been carried out. Since food is the reward for appropriate
behaviour, trainers must rely on control of feeding motivation.

 Conservation
===================

The number of sharks being caught has increased rapidly over the last 50 years.



The majority of shark fisheries around the globe have little monitoring or management. With the
rise in demand of shark products there is a greater pressure on fisheries.[31] Stocks decline and
collapse because sharks are long-lived apex predators with comparatively small populations, which
makes it difficult for them breed rapidly enough to maintain population levels. Major declines in
shark stocks have been recorded in recent years - some species have been depleted by over 90% over
the past 20-30 years with a population decline of 70% not being unusual.[32] Many governments and
the UN have acknowledged the need for shark fisheries management, but due to the low economic
value of shark fisheries, the small volumes of products produced and the poor public image of
sharks, little progress has been made.

Many other threats to sharks include habitat alteration, damage and loss from coastal
developments, pollution and the impact of fisheries on the seabed and prey species.

A Canadian-made documentary, Sharkwater is raising awareness of the depletion of the world's shark
population.

 Shark fishery
====================

A 14-foot, 544?kg (1200?pound) Tiger shark caught in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu in 1966



Every year, an estimate states that 26 to 73 million (median value is at 38 million) sharks are
killed by people in commercial and recreational fishing.[33] In the past, sharks were killed
simply for the sport of landing a good fighting fish (such as the shortfin mako sharks). Shark
skin is covered with dermal denticles, which are similar to tiny teeth, and was used for purposes
similar to sandpaper. Other sharks are hunted for food (Atlantic thresher, shortfin mako and
others), and some species for other products.[34]

Sharks are a common seafood in many places around the world, including Japan and Australia. In the
Australian State of Victoria shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips, in which
fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled and served alongside chips. When served
in fish and chip shops, it is called flake.

Sharks are often killed for shark fin soup: the finning process involves capture of a live shark,
the removal of the fin with a hot metal blade, and the release of the live animal back into the
water. Sharks are also killed for their meat. The meat of dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks,
skates and rays is in high demand by European consumers.] The situation in Canada and the United
States is similar: the blue shark is sought as a sport fish while the porbeagle, mako and spiny
dogfish are part of the commercial fishery.] There have been cases where hundreds of de-finned
sharks were swept up on local beaches without any way to convey themselves back into the sea.]
Conservationists have campaigned for changes in the law to make finning illegal in the U.S.

Shark cartilage has been advocated as effective against cancer and for treatment of
osteoarthritis(This is because many people believe that sharks cannot get cancer and that taking
it will prevent people from getting these diseases, which is untrue.) . However, a trial by Mayo
Clinic found no effect in advanced cancer patients.

Sharks generally reach sexual maturity slowly and produce very few offspring in comparison to
other fishes that are harvested. This has caused concern among biologists regarding the increase
in effort applied to catching sharks over time, and many species are considered to be threatened.

Some organizations, such as the Shark Trust, campaign to limit shark fishing.

 Sharks in mythology
==========================


Sharks figure prominently in the Hawaiian mythology. There are stories of shark men who have shark
jaws on their back. They could change form between shark and human at any time they desired. A
common theme in the stories was that the shark men would warn beach-goers that sharks were in the
waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and go swimming, subsequently being
eaten by the same shark man who warned them not to enter the water.

Hawaiian mythology also contained many shark gods. They believed that sharks were guardians of the
sea, and called them Aumakua:[35]


* Kamohoali'i - The best known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favoured
  brother of Pele,[36] and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii. He was able to take on all
  human and fish forms. A summit cliff on the crater of Kilauea is considered to be one of his
  most sacred spots. At one point he had a he'iau (temple or shrine) dedicated to him on every
  piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of Moloka'i.
* Ka'ahupahau - This goddess was born human, with her defining characteristic being her red
  hair. She was later transformed into shark form and was believed to protect the people who lived
  on O'ahu from sharks. She was also believed to live near Pearl Harbor.
* Kaholia Kane - This was the shark god of the ali'i Kalaniopu'u and he was believed to live in
  a cave at Puhi, Kaua'i.
* Kane'ae - The shark goddess who transformed into a human in order to experience the joy of
  dancing.
* Kane'apua - Most commonly, he was the brother of Pele and Kamohoali'i. He was a trickster god
  who performed many heroic feats, including the calming of two legendary colliding hills that
  destroyed canoes trying to pass between.
* Kawelomahamahai'a - Another human, he was transformed into a shark.
* Keali'ikau 'o Ka'u - He was the cousin of Pele and son of Kua. He was called the protector of
  the Ka'u people. He had an affair with a human girl, who gave birth to a helpful green shark.
* Kua - This was the main shark god of the people of Ka'u, and believed to be their ancestor.
* Kuhaimoana - He was the brother of Pele and lived in the Ka'ula islet. He was said to be
  30?fathoms (55?m) long and was the husband of Ka'ahupahau.
* Kauhuhu - He was a fierce king shark that lived in a cave in Kipahulu on the island of Maui.
  He sometimes moved to another cave on the windward side of island of Moloka'i.
* Kane-i-kokala - A kind shark god that saved shipwrecked people by taking them to shore. The
  people who worshipped him feared to eat, touch or cross the smoke of the kokala, his sacred fish.

In other Pacific Ocean cultures, Dakuwanga was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls.

 Beliefs about sharks
===========================


In ancient Greece, it was forbidden to eat shark flesh at women's festivals.

A popular myth is that sharks are immune to disease and cancer; however, this is untrue. There are
both diseases and parasites that affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to
cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical
studies that have shown sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.[37]
