 History
==============


It is unknown exactly when ferrets were first domesticated, but ferret remains have been dated to
1500 BC.[1]

Some say the ancient Egyptians had ferrets, but it is more likely that Europeans visiting Egypt
saw cats and thought using a small carnivore to protect grain stores was a useful idea.] The
ancient Greeks kept pet ferrets: they are mentioned by Aristophanes.] In Greek Mythology, ferrets
were connected to women's birthing rituals.]

The ferret was most likely bred from the European Polecat (Mustela putorius), though it is also
possible that ferrets come from the Steppe polecat (Mustela eversmannii) or some hybridization
thereof.

Wild ferrets, in the form of ferret-polecat hybrids, do still exist. New Zealand has the world's
largest feral population of these hybrids. [2] (See Ferrets as pests, below, for more details.)

The 1st Battalion of the British Armed Forces, the Yorkshire Regiment, keeps two ferrets, Imphal
and Quebec, as its unofficial mascots, named after the battalion's battle honors.[3]

 Ferreting
================


For hundreds of years, the main use of ferrets was for hunting, or ferreting. With their long,
lean build and curious nature, ferrets are very well equipped for getting down holes and chasing
rodents and rabbits ("rabbiting") out of their burrows. Caesar Augustus sent ferrets (named
"viverrae" by Plinius) to the Balearic Islands to control the rabbit plagues in 6 BC.They are
still used for hunting in some countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, where
rabbits are considered a plague species and the combination of a few small nets and a ferret or
two remains very effective despite technological advances. However, the practice is illegal in
several countries, where it is feared that ferreting could unbalance the ecology.

Ferrets were first brought to the New World in the 17th century and were used extensively from
1860 until the start of World War II to protect grain stores in the American West. They first
became popular as pets in the mid-1970s, chiefly thanks to Dr. Wendy Winstead, a veterinarian and
former folk singer who sold ferrets to a number of celebrities and made many TV appearances with
her own ferrets.

 Ferrets as pets
======================

Ferrets sleeping in a pile



Ferrets are energetic, curious, and always interested in their surroundings. They actively solicit
play with their owners.

Ferrets tend to be very nippy as kits, requiring patience and persistence in handling. Nipping is
the act of biting in a playful manner reminiscent of mock fighting and sparring; young ferrets are
also more prone to chewing and teething. Older ferrets tend to chew far less frequently and, when
trained correctly, almost never nip a human hand. Younger inexperienced ferrets have a tendency to
nip and bite harder, which may irritate an owner who does not understand ferret behavior. For this
reason, some young ferrets end up neglected, when owner's patience runs out and the ferret is
abandoned to its cage.

Ferret life-span can vary widely, but usually falls between six and ten years, though in rare
cases ferrets can live into their early teens.

In the USA ferrets typically cost around $75 to $150. In Australia it is usually from $50.00 to
$80.00 and the desexing is done by the new owners. Additional costs of a secure cage, food,
bedding, veterinary check-ups, and medicine should be taken into consideration by prospective
owners. Descenting is often considered a mutilation by vets in Australia.

 Dangers to ferrets
=========================


It has been suggested that ferrets were bred for curiosity; whether this is true or not, their
curiosity often exceeds their common sense. Ferrets are very good at getting into holes in walls,
doors, cupboards, or behind household appliances, where they can be injured or killed by
electrical wiring, fans, and other dangerous items. Many enjoy chewing items made of soft rubber,
foam, or sponge, which present the risk of intestinal blockage and death if ingested. Serious and
sometimes fatal injuries have resulted from ferrets chewing on electrical cords. Screen doors can
be damaged by a ferret's claws, and dryer vents often become escape routes to the outdoors. Unlike
dogs and cats, most ferrets have little homing instinct and cannot survive as strays, usually
causing them to die of dehydration within a few days unless found.]

Recliners are a leading cause of accidental death in ferrets.[4] Ferrets will often climb inside
the springs and can be injured or killed once the chair is put into a reclined position. Fold-out
sofas cause similar problems.

For these reasons, steps must be taken to "ferret-proof" a home before acquiring one as a pet.
Ferret-proofing a house is an ongoing task that involves carefully going through each room,
removing items dangerous to ferrets and covering over any holes or potential escape routes. As
ferrets can open improperly latched cupboards or doors by rolling over and clawing at the bottom
edge, many owners buy childproof latches or keep cleaning products in high, out-of-reach places.
However, ferrets can typically fit through any hole as small as the size of their head, making
some childproof latches ineffective.

Some countries prefer to house their pets outdoors in sheds, and not indoors the American way.
This is becoming more popular, as owners realise the photoperiod affects to the ferret being kept
in light after the sun goes down.

 Diet
===========


Ferrets are obligate carnivores; the natural diet of their wild ancestors consisted of whole small
prey--meat, organs, bones, skin, feathers, fur--not just meat.

Some ferret owners feed a meat-based diet consisting of whole prey like mice,rabbits, along with
raw meat like chicken, beef, veal, kangaroo and wallaby. This is preferred in Europe and
Australia, and becoming increasingly popular in the US as concerns are raised about the high level
of carbohydrate in some processed ferret foods. Australians also feed a lactose-free milk.

Alternatively there is a wide variety of commercial ferret foods available. Kitten foods can also
be given, so long as they provide the high protein and fat content required by the ferret's
metabolism. Most adult cat foods and many kitten foods are unsuitable for ferrets though, because
of their low protein content. Ideally, a ferret food should contain 32-38% meat based protein and
15-20% fat. Low quality pet foods often contain grain-based proteins which ferrets cannot properly
digest.

Ferrets often have a fondness for sweets like raisins, bananas, peanut butter, and pieces of
cereal. Such treats should be given sparingly (if at all), as their high sugar content has been
linked to insulinoma and other diseases. In fact, veterinarians suggest not feeding raisins and
the like to ferrets at all because they are known to hide their food, raising the possibility of a
ferret hiding a large amount of raisins over time and then dangerously consuming them all at once.

 Feeding the Sick Ferret
==============================


If a ferret does not eat enough or loses too much weight, it is a good indication that the ferret
is sick, and should be taken to a veterinarian. Sick ferrets and those recovering from an illness
or surgery will often need to have their diet supplemented. Often hand-feeding or, in extreme
cases, force feeding may be necessary. This should not be undertaken without the advice of a
veterinarian. Many recipes are available for feeding sick ferrets. They are informally known as
"duck soup".

 Activity
===============

Ferrets spend 14 to 18 hours a day sleeping, but when awake they are very active, exploring their
surroundings relentlessly. Ferrets are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and
dusk. However, ferrets are known to easily adapt to the schedule of their owners. If kept in a
cage, they should be let out for a few hours daily to get exercise and satisfy their curiosity.
When ferrets are kept in their cages for too long, their walking ability can be affected, and they
may become subject to depression or "cage stress." Ferrets, like cats, can use a litter box with
training, though are not always totally litter box trainable.

Ferrets are also fine backyard companions and especially enjoy "helping" their owners in the
garden. However, they should not be allowed to wander; ferrets are fearless to the point of
foolishness and will get into whatever holes they will find, including storm drains. Whenever they
are outside, they should be closely supervised and preferably kept on a harness leash designed for
ferrets. There are different types of harnesses, and some ferrets prefer certain kinds. The
H-shaped harness is the most popular. Collars will not work for ferrets as they do for dogs; a
ferret can easily slip out of a collar because their heads are about the same width as their necks.

Additional care should be taken during mosquito and tick season, as ferrets are susceptible to the
diseases carried by these parasites. Ticks can attach themselves and begin to draw blood. When the
tick gets full, it regurgitates some blood and tick saliva back into the ferret, which is how Lyme
and other diseases can be transmitted. Ordinarily, the regurgitation happens between five to 24
hours after the tick attaches. The key to keeping a ferret healthy is early removal of ticks using
proper methods to avoid tick regurgitation, and prevention when in environments where encountering
ticks is likely. Mosquitoes for their part can carry heart worms and the West Nile virus. Fleas
can cause extreme skin irritation and can be intermediate hosts for tapeworms, one of which could
potentially kill a ferret because of the ferret's small size. Also because of their small size,
ferrets can also be regarded as prey by birds such as the hawk, and by larger snakes. Their small
size also makes the venom of a bee, wasp or spider much more serious than for a larger mammal. For
these reasons, an owner should be vigilant when a ferret is outdoors.

 Play

Ferret playing tug with a hair pick



Since ferrets are social animals, many of them are playful by nature and are happy to play with
humans. Play for a ferret can involve hide-and-seek games, or some form of predator/prey game in
which either the human attempts to catch the ferret or the ferret to catch the human.

Like a playful kitten, a ferret usually will not bite its human companions enough to cause pain,
but will instead gently grab a toe or finger in their mouth and roll around with it. However,
ferrets that have been abused or are in extreme pain will bite a human. Ferrets have strong bites
and can sometimes bite through human skin, especially children's. Once properly socialized,
however, domesticated ferrets will very rarely, if ever, bite humans.

Most kitten toys work well with ferrets. Toys made of rubber or foam should be avoided, however,
as ferrets can chew off and swallow small pieces, possibly leading to intestinal blockage and
possible choking. Ferrets love playing tug of war with toys and stuffed animals.

Ferrets are easily entertained, so spending large amounts of money on ferret toys is unneccessary.
Since ferrets are burrowing animals by nature, they will happily busy themselves with basic
household objects such as cardboard boxes, blankets, and shoes. Dryer vent tubing can be used to
create an interactive tunnel system, which can easily be collapsed and stored when not in use.

Ferrets regularly wrestle with each other, and with their owners.

When ferrets are especially excited, they will perform the weasel war dance, a frenzied series of
sideways hops. This is often accompanied by a soft chuckling noise, called dooking by many ferret
owners.

Ferrets love to play and, besides eating and sleeping, spend most of their time at play. They love
to steal small items, so anything of special value must be kept out of their reach. Also, ferrets
can drag and move things that are much bigger than they are.

 Ferrets and children
===========================

Child with ferrets



Ferrets can make good pets for children. However, like all other domesticated animals, they should
not be allowed unsupervised near infants or very young children. There have been cases where
ferrets have severely injured babies, in at least one instance mauling a child's face.[5] Given
that young children and ferrets can both be excitable and prone to rough play, interaction between
ferrets and young children must always be closely supervised -- for the protection of both the
children and the ferrets.

It is important to note that this danger is often overstated. In comparison, dogs account for
800,000 bites annually that require medical attention in the US and 20 deaths per year.

 Social nature
====================

Ferrets at play



Ferrets are extremely social animals, and most enjoy playing and interacting with other ferrets.
Many ferret owners recommend owning two or three ferrets for this reason, but there is nothing
wrong with owning one ferret, provided that it receives lots of play time and attention. Ferrets
frequently bond emotionally with their owners as well as to other ferrets and bonded pairs are
often observed to die just a few days apart from each other.

Ferrets have been known to play with household cats and small non-aggressive dogs. However, great
care must be taken when introducing ferrets to any new animal, particularly terriers and other
breeds with instincts for catching ferret-sized prey. Ferrets will normally not get along with
rabbits, birds, rats, mice, guinea pigs and small reptiles, some of which would have comprised
part of the diet of their wild ancestors, and so may attack them given a chance.

 Unusual Behaviors
========================

Manka the Ferret



Ferrets have a repertoire of unusual behaviors that can make them both endearing and difficult
pets for some people. Ferrets enjoy picking up objects and carrying them off to "hidey holes". It
is difficult to predict what objects a ferret will decide are worthy of hoarding, but in addition
to play toys owners have found socks, 10 lb bags of onions, keys, calculators, silverware,
sponges, toilet paper rolls, game controllers, etc... Ferrets will also tear open packages and
other containers to see what is inside or explore the inside of the package. Ferrets have a strong
interest in holes, pipes and other small enclosed areas. Ferrets seem compelled to explore holes.
This makes them useful for rabbiting and tasks such as running pull lines through conduits but it
also makes them prone to getting lost. Ferrets are also very curious animals and relatively
fearless. This often puts them in situations in which they will confront and try to play with
large animals that are dangerous to the ferret. Ferrets' curiosity can also lead them to wander
off until they are unable to find their way home. Though ferrets sleep more than almost all
domesticated animals, they are usually very active when awake. Their energy level during play is
almost frenetic and can be too much for many other pets, particularly older animals which may feel
harassed by the ferret's tenacious attention.

The War Dance:

It is easy to confuse this invitation to play and/or expression of happy excitement with a
threatening gesture. Posture becomes rigid with wide open jaws, momentary eye contact, followed by
thrashing or turning of the head from side to side, arching the back, piloerection and hopping to
the side or backwards while facing the intended playmate. This is often accompanied by an excited
laughing/panting sound that may sound like a hiss. If responded to appropriately, this behavior
will usually break into a game of chase, pounce and wrestle. Ferrets in war dances are accident
prone, often hopping into obstacles or tripping over their own feet to great comic effect. [6],
[7], [8]

 Care
===========


Pet female ferrets should be spayed if they are not going to be bred. Ferrets go into extended
heat and an unbred ferret without medical intervention can die of aplastic anemia.

Ferrets need their nails clipped and ears cleaned on a regular basis. Regular nail clippers will
work, and most pet stores supply ferret specific ear cleaning solution. Most ferrets also shed
twice a year, in the spring and fall; during this time, it is a good idea to brush them regularly
and give them a laxative or petroleum jelly to help any ingested fur pass more easily through the
digestive tract.

It is a misconception that ferrets smell bad. The bad smell usually attributed to ferrets comes
from their bedding and litter box. Bedding should be washed or changed out regularly, and a
ferret's litter box should be cleaned every day, or at least every other day. Depending on the
cage, it is a good idea to take it apart and hose it down every once in a while, to remove
material stuck in crevices.

Ferret after a shower



Frequent bathing is not necessary. Most sources recommend bathing no more frequently than once
every 6 months], and many owners don't bathe their ferrets at all unless something needs to be
washed off. Over-frequent bathing can actually increase a ferret's natural smell, as its skin
works overtime to replace the oils lost in the bath.]

However, some owners find that their ferrets enjoy baths and/or showers. In which case using a
specific ferret shampoo that replenishes the oils in the ferret's coat can help to avoid the
potential problem of dry skin. Just remember never to leave your ferret alone in deep water from
which it may have trouble escaping. Water is a highly subjective taste among ferrets, and some
ferrets may become anxious when exposed.

It is recommended that ferrets are taken to a veterinarian for a yearly checkup. Ferrets often
hide symptoms of illness very well, perhaps from an instinct to not appear weak to predators in
the wild. Any out-of-the-ordinary behavior is good cause for a consultation. Ferrets have high
metabolisms and cancers can progress at an alarmingly fast rate. Early detection is critical.

 Other uses of ferrets
============================


Ferrets have been used to run wires and cables through large conduits. Event organizers in London
used ferrets to run TV and sound cables for both the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales to Lady
Diana Spencer, and for the "Party in the Park" concert held in Greenwich Park on Millennium Eve.[9]

Since they share many anatomical and physiological features with humans, ferrets are extensively
used as experimental subjects in biomedical research, in fields such as virology, reproductive
physiology, anatomy, endocrinology and neuroscience.

 Ferret biology and health concerns
=========================================


Like many other carnivores, ferrets have scent glands near their anuses, the secretions from which
are used in scent marking. It has been reported that ferrets can recognize individuals from these
anal gland secretions, as well as the sex of unfamiliar individuals.[10] Ferrets may also use
urine marking for sex and individual recognitions.[11]

Like skunks, ferrets can release their anal gland secretions when startled or scared, but the
smell dissipates rapidly. Most pet ferrets in the US are sold de-scented, with their anal glands
removed. In the UK, de-scenting is considered an unnecessary mutilation, and is illegal without
some compelling medical justification. In Australia, the general opinion is that the animal does
not need to be de-scented.

Males, if not neutered, are extremely smelly (for lack of a better word). It is considered
preferable to delay neutering until sexual maturity has been reached, at approximately 6 months
old, after the full descent of the testicles. neutering the male will reduce the smell to almost
nothing. The same applies for females, but neutering there has more pressing reasons, as mentioned
above with aplastic anemia.

Many domestic ferrets are known to suffer from several distinct health problems. Among the most
common are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system. Certain breeds
may also have a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome .

Most ferrets will ultimately contract a life-threatening illness.] It is uncommon for the domestic
ferret to die from old age. Early detection and treatment of illnesses is the key to ensuring that
ferrets live long and fun-filled lives.

 Adrenal disease
======================


Adrenal disease, a growth of the adrenal glands that can be either hyperplasia or cancer, is most
often diagnosed by signs like unusual hair loss, increased aggression, difficulty urinating or
defecating, or agitation when urinating, and (in the case of females) an enlarged vulva. Even if
the growth is benign, it can still cause a hormonal imbalance which can have devastating effects
on the ferret's health.

Treatment options include surgery to excise the affected glands, melatonin implants, steroids
and/or hormone therapy. The causes of adrenal disease are as yet uncertain, but speculated
triggers include unnatural light cycles, diets based around processed ferret foods, and prepuberty
neutering. It has also been suggested that there may be a hereditary component to adrenal
disease.[12]

Adrenal disease is usually detected during the spring or fall. This is because adrenal disease
affects the hormones that make the fur grow, so when ferrets with adrenal disease shed their
winter coat they simply don't grow it back because of the disease. The hair loss pattern is very
specific for adrenal disease: It begins at the base of the tail and then continues up the ferret's
back.

 Insulinoma
=================


Ferrets are also known to suffer from insulinoma, a cancer of the pancreas. The growth of
cancerous nodules on the lobes of the pancreas sometimes, but not always, leads to an increase in
the production of insulin, which regulates the rate at which the ferret's body metabolizes blood
glucose. Too much insulin will cause blood sugar to drop, resulting in lethargy, seizures, and
ultimately death. Symptoms of insulinoma include episodes of lethargy, drooling, pawing and/or
foaming at the mouth, staring "blankly" into space, and seizures.

Like adrenal cancer, the exact cause of insulinoma is unknown. It is speculated that the diets of
domestic ferrets are too far removed from the natural diets of their polecat ancestors, and
include too much sugar or simple carbohydrates.

Treatment for insulinoma may include surgical excision of the cancerous lobes, pharmaceutical
treatment with steroids that suppress the production of insulin, supplemental changes in diet
(most often poultry-based baby food), or a combination thereof. Unfortunately, the growth of the
tumors cannot be completely stopped, and the ferret will eventually suffer a reoccurrence of
symptoms.

 Lymphoma
===============


Lymphoma/lymphosarcoma is the most common malignancy in ferrets. Ferret lymphosarcoma occurs in
two forms -- juvenile lymphosarcoma, a fast-growing type that affects ferrets younger than two
years, and adult lymphosarcoma, a slower growing form that affects ferrets four to seven years old.

In juvenile ferret lymphosarcoma, large, immature lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) rapidly invade the
thymus and/or the organs of the abdominal cavity, particularly the liver and spleen. In adult
ferret lymphosarcoma, the lymph nodes in the limbs and abdominal cavity become swollen early on
due to invasion by small, mature lymphocytes. Invasion of organs, such as the liver, kidney,
lungs, and spleen, occurs later on, and the disease may be far advanced before symptoms are
noticeable.

As in humans, ferret lymphosarcoma can be treated surgically, with radiation therapy, chemotherapy
or a combination thereof. The long-term prognosis is rarely bright, however, and this treatment is
intended to improve quality of life with the disease.

 Viral diseases
=====================


ECE (epizootic catarrhal enteritis), is a viral disease that first appeared in the northeastern US
in 1994, is an inflammation of the mucous membranes in the intestine. In ferrets, the disease
manifests itself as severe diarrhea (often of a bright green color), loss of appetite, and severe
weight loss. The virus can be passed via fluids and indirectly between humans. Although it was
often fatal when first discovered, ECE is less of a threat nowadays with the right supportive care
which usually includes hospitalization with intravenous fluids. The virus is especially
threatening to older ferrets and requires immediate attention.

ADV, the Aleutian disease virus, is a parvovirus originally found among mink in the Aleutian
islands in the early 20th century. In ferrets, the virus affects the immune system (causing it to
produce non-neutralizing antibodies) and many internal organs, particularly the kidneys. There is
no cure or vaccine for the disease, and ferrets may carry the virus for months or years without
any external symptoms. As a result, many ferret organizations and shelters recommend that owners
test their pets for the virus regularly, separating them from other ferrets if they test positive.

Canine distemper is an extremely contagious virus that is almost always fatal. Being strict indoor
pets does not necessarily protect ferrets as owners may bring the virus home on their clothes or
their shoes. It is recommended that ferrets receive an annual vaccination. While this is vital to
protect a ferret's health, it is not without controversy, and can cause anaphylactic shock. Some
veterinarians prefer to pre-treat ferrets with injectable benadryl. In the United States there are
currently two vaccines that can be used on ferrets, only one of which is USDA approved. In other
countries of the world where there are no vaccines licensed for use on ferrets, dog canine
distemper vaccines are commonly administered instead.

 Waardenburg-Like Coloring
================================


Ferrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head, primarily blazes, badgers, and
pandas, almost certainly carry a congenital defect which shares some similarities to Waardenburg
syndrome. This causes, among other things, a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the
skull, causing the white face markings but also partial or total deafness. It is estimated as many
as 75% of ferrets with these Waardenburg-Like Colorings are deaf. Beyond that, the cranial
deformation also causes a higher instance of stillborn ferret kits, and occasionally cleft
palates. Because of this, many breeders will not breed Waardenburg-patterned ferrets.

 Terminology and Coloring
===============================

A sable ferret, the most common color variation



Male ferrets are called hobs; female ferrets are jills. A spayed female is a sprite, and a
neutered male is a gib. Ferrets under one year old are known as kits. A group of ferrets is known
as a business.

Ferrets come in a variety of coat colors and patterns. The ones recognized by the American Ferret
Association are as follows:


Colors:

* Albino
* Black
* Black Sable
* Champagne
* Cinnamon
* Dark-eyed White
* Sable
 

Color concentrations:

* Standards
* Roans
* Point (Siamese)
* Solids
 

Markings:

* Blaze
* Panda
* Mitt[13]


White ferrets were favored in the Middle Ages for the ease in seeing them in thick undergrowth,
and ownership was restricted to those earning at least 40 shillings a year (a large sum then).]
Leonardo's painting Lady with an Ermine is likely mislabeled; the animal is probably a ferret, not
a stoat, for which "ermine" is an alternative name (the latter strictly applying only to the
animal in its white winter coat). Similarly, the "Ermine portrait of Queen Elizabeth the First"
shows her with her pet ferret, who has been decorated with painted-on heraldic ermine spots.

 Ferrets as pests
=======================


In 1877, farmers in New Zealand demanded that ferrets be introduced into the country to control
the rabbit population, which was also introduced by humans. Five ferrets were imported in 1879,
and in 1882-1883, 32 shipments of ferrets were made from London, totaling 1217 animals. Only 678
landed, and 198 were sent from Melbourne, Australia. On the voyage, the ferrets were mated with
the European polecat, creating a number of hybrids that were capable of surviving in the wild. In
1884 and 1886, close to 4000 ferrets and ferret hybrids, 3099 weasels and 137 stoats were turned
loose.[14] Concern was raised that these animals would eventually prey on indigenous wildlife once
rabbit populations dropped, and this is exactly what happened to New Zealand bird species which
had evolved free from mammalian predators.

Ferrets were once banned in many US states, but most of these laws were rescinded in the 1980s and
90s as they became popular pets. Ferrets are still illegal in California under Fish and Game Code
Section 2118[15] and the California Code of Regulations.[16]

Additionally, "Ferrets are strictly prohibited as pets under Hawaii law because they are potential
carriers of the rabies virus";[17] the territory of Puerto Rico has a similar law.]

Ferrets are also restricted by individual cities, such as, Washington, DC, Beaumont, Texas,
Columbia, Missouri, New York City, and Bloomington, Minnesota.] They are also prohibited on many
military bases.] A permit to own a ferret is needed in other areas, including and Rhode Island.]
Illinois does not require a permit to merely possess a ferret, but a permit is required to breed
ferrets.[18] It was once illegal to own ferrets in Dallas, Texas,[19] but the current Dallas City
Code for Animals includes regulations for the vaccination of ferrets.[20]

 Import laws
==================

 Japan
============


Although previously pet ferrets were allowed to be brought into Japan, that is no longer the case.
Individual pet ferrets cannot be brought into Japan without proper documents. However, licensed
breeders such as Canadian Farms, PVF, Marshall's, etc... have a special agreement that still
allows the import of those ferrets from those companies.

 Canada
=============


Ferrets brought from anywhere except the US require a Permit to Import from the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency Animal Health Office. Ferrets from the US require only a vaccination certificate
signed by a veterinarian. Ferrets under three months old are not subject to any restrictions for
importation.[29]

 European Union
=====================


As of July 2004, dogs, cats, and ferrets can travel freely within the European Union under the
PETS travel scheme. To cross a border within the EU, ferrets require at minimum an EU PETS
passport and an identification microchip (though some countries will accept a tattoo instead).
Vaccinations are also required; most countries require a rabies vaccine, and some also require a
distemper vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas 24 to 48 hours before entry. PETS travel
information is available from any EU veterinarian or on government websites.

 United Kingdom
=====================


The UK accepts ferrets under the PETS travel scheme. Ferrets must be microchipped, vaccinated
against rabies, and documented. They must be treated for ticks and tapeworms 24 to 48 hours before
entry. They must also arrive via an authorized route. Ferrets arriving from outside the EU may be
subject to a six-month quarantine.[30]

 Australia
================


Ferrets cannot be imported into Australia at all. A report drafted in August 2000 seems to be the
only effort made to date to change the situation.[31]
