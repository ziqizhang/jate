# Value type: string
# Required
# The Solr uniqueKey field encodes the identity semantics of a document.

#fieldname_id

# Value type: string
# Required
# THIS FIELD IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE FIELD THAT STORES TERM CANDIDATES
# 
# This field stores n-grams from a corpus. It is configured to OVER-GENERATE terms
# so n-grams that are not necessarily term candidates can be generated. The goal of
# this field is to be used as a lookup source for statistic information of term 
# candidates.
# MUST BE configured to store termVector and termOffset information
solr_field_content_ngrams=jate_ngraminfo

# Value type: string
# Required
# Solr Content/Text Field to index and store candidate terms. 
# MUST BE INDEXED by a TR aware analyser with termVectors and termOffsets set to true
# Refer to "schema.xml" for the example setting
solr_field_content_terms=jate_cterms


# Value type: string
# OPTIONAL
# This is a Solr Content/Text dynamic field mapping document parts by Tika (e.g.,title, links, first paragraph, etc.)
# MUST BE INDEXED by a TR aware analyser
# 
# Mapping document parts with terms provide a way to trace the part of a document where a term is found. 
# Such information can be used by some ATR algorithms. However most ATR
# 	algorithms do not use such information.
# Refer to "schema.xml" for the example setting
# 
# 	and recommend to set meaningful field name "_*" + field type abbv. (e.g., "*_text2Terms") for indexed dynamic fields
#   Please also refer to the example in App* source code in comments about how to use the functionality
solr_field_map_doc_parts=jate_cterms_f*

# Value type: string
# OPTIONAL
# Solr string field to index and store final filtered candidate terms
# By default, the filtered candidate terms (i.e., domain terms) will not be indexed and stored
solr_field_domain_terms=jate_domain_terms
